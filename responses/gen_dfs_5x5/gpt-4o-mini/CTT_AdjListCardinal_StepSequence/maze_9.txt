INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> ( 0 , 1 ) <--> SOUTH ( 1 , 2 ) <--> NORTH ( 1 , 4 ) <--> NORTH ( 1 , 3 ) <--> SOUTH ( 2 , 3 ) <--> SOUTH ( 3 , 4 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 3 ) <--> SOUTH ( 4 , 4 ) <--> NORTH ( 0 , 2 ) <--> EAST ( 0 , 4 ) <--> WEST ( 1 , 1 ) <--> EAST ( 1 , 4 ) <--> WEST ( 4 , 3 ) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> ( 2 , 4 ) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> ( 3 , 4 ) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> ( 2 , 4 ) SOUTH ( 3 , 4 ) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To generate a path from the origin (2, 4) to the target (3, 4) in the given maze configuration, we can utilize the adjacency relationships defined. 

Starting from the origin (2, 4), let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **From (2, 4)**:
   - Can move SOUTH to (3, 4).

Since the target (3, 4) is directly south of the origin (2, 4), we can move directly to the target.

Here's the step-by-step path form:

```
<PATH_START>
(2, 4) SOUTH (3, 4)
<PATH_END>
```

This provides a direct solution with minimal steps, as there are no obstacles preventing the move from (2, 4) to (3, 4).
