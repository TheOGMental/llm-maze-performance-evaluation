<ADJLIST_START> ( 0 , 0 ) <--> SOUTH ( 1 , 1 ) <--> NORTH ( 0 , 3 ) <--> SOUTH ( 1 , 4 ) <--> NORTH ( 2 , 4 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 0 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 4 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 2 ) <--> SOUTH ( 3 , 4 ) <--> SOUTH ( 0 , 0 ) <--> EAST ( 0 , 4 ) <--> WEST ( 1 , 1 ) <--> EAST ( 1 , 2 ) <--> EAST ( 2 , 1 ) <--> WEST ( 2 , 1 ) <--> EAST ( 2 , 2 ) <--> EAST ( 3 , 1 ) <--> WEST ( 3 , 1 ) <--> EAST ( 4 , 2 ) <--> EAST ( 4 , 3 ) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> ( 0 , 0 ) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> ( 0 , 4 ) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> ( 0 , 0 ) EAST ( 0 , 1 ) SOUTH ( 1 , 1 ) EAST ( 1 , 2 ) EAST ( 1 , 3 ) NORTH ( 0 , 3 ) EAST ( 0 , 4 ) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (0, 4) in the provided maze, we will utilize the connections defined in the adjacency list. The path will be constructed step-by-step based on the available directions.

Hereâ€™s the process to reach from (0, 0) to (0, 4):

1. Start at (0, 0).
2. Move SOUTH to (1, 1).
3. Move EAST to (1, 2) (from (1, 1)).
4. Move EAST to (1, 3) (from (1, 2)).
5. Move EAST to (1, 4) (from (1, 3)).
6. Move NORTH to (0, 4) (from (1, 4)).

Thus, the complete path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (0, 4) is as follows:

```
<PATH_START>
( 0 , 0 ) SOUTH ( 1 , 1 ) EAST ( 1 , 2 ) EAST ( 1 , 3 ) EAST ( 1 , 4 ) NORTH ( 0 , 4 )
<PATH_END>
```

This represents a valid path through the maze from the starting point to the target.
