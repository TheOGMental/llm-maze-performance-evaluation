EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> ( 0 , 1 ) SOUTH ( 1 , 1 ) SOUTH ( 2 , 1 ) WEST ( 2 , 0 ) SOUTH ( 3 , 0 ) SOUTH ( 4 , 0 ) EAST ( 4 , 1 ) NORTH ( 3 , 1 ) EAST ( 3 , 2 ) NORTH ( 2 , 2 ) NORTH ( 1 , 2 ) EAST ( 1 , 3 ) NORTH ( 0 , 3 ) EAST ( 0 , 4 ) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0, 1) to the target (0, 4) in the given maze configuration, we'll use the adjacency list to map the connections between the coordinates. 

### Given Adjacency List:

1. (0, 1) connects to (0, 3) SOUTH
2. (0, 3) connects to (0, 4) SOUTH
3. (1, 1) connects to (1, 2) SOUTH
4. (1, 2) connects to (1, 4) SOUTH
5. (2, 0) connects to (3, 2) SOUTH
6. (3, 2) connects to (3, 3) NORTH
7. (4, 0) connects to (4, 1) NORTH
8. (4, 1) connects to (4, 2) NORTH
9. (1, 3) connects to (0, 4) WEST/ EAST
10. And more connections are given, but we will focus on the path from (0, 1) to (0, 4).

### Path from (0, 1) to (0, 4):

1. Start at (0, 1)
2. Move SOUTH to (0, 3) (2nd move)
3. Move SOUTH to (0, 4) (3rd move)

### Complete Path Notation:

1. **(0, 1)** SOUTH **(0, 3)** SOUTH **(0, 4)**

### Final Path Output:

```
<PATH_START> ( 0 , 1 ) SOUTH ( 0 , 3 ) SOUTH ( 0 , 4 ) <PATH_END>
```
