OUTPUT:
To create a path from the start point "S" to the end point "E" in the given maze, let's first identify their locations:

- "S" (Start) is located at the coordinates (5, 4).
- "E" (End) is located at the coordinates (6, 4).

Now, I will outline a path from "S" to "E". Starting from (5, 4):

1. Move Up to (4, 4).
2. Move Up to (3, 4).
3. Move Up to (2, 4).
4. Move Right to (2, 5).
5. Move Right to (2, 6).
6. Move Down to (3, 6).
7. Move Down to (4, 6).
8. Move Down to (5, 6).
9. Move Down to (6, 6).
10. Move Left to (6, 5).
11. Move Left to (6, 4) where "E" is located.

The path described allows us to navigate from "S" to "E" without hitting any walls. The moves can be summarized as: 

- Up × 3
- Right × 2
- Down × 4
- Left × 2

This ensures a clear route through the open paths of the maze.
