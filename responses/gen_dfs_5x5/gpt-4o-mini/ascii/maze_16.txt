OUTPUT:
To navigate through the maze, we will represent the layout and the path taken from 'S' (Start) to 'E' (End). Here's the maze with its original layout:

```
###########
#S  # #  E#
# # ### # #
# #     # #
######### #
#       # #
# ####### #
#     # # #
##### ### #
# # #     #
###########
```

The solution will be a step-by-step path to get from 'S' to 'E'. The path will be represented with 'X', and I'll indicate the path clearly within the maze.

Hereâ€™s a solution path from 'S' to 'E':

1. Start at 'S' (1, 1).
2. Move down (to (2, 1)).
3. Move down (to (3, 1)).
4. Move down (to (4, 1)).
5. Move right (to (4, 2)).
6. Move right (to (4, 3)).
7. Move up (to (3, 3)).
8. Move up (to (2, 3)).
9. Move up (to (1, 3)).
10. Move right (to (1, 4)).
11. Move right (to (1, 5)).
12. Move down (to (2, 5)).
13. Move down (to (3, 5)).
14. Move down (to (4, 5)).
15. Move down (to (5, 5)).
16. Move down (to (6, 5)).
17. Move down (to (7, 5)).
18. Move left (to (7, 4)).
19. Move left (to (7, 3)).
20. Move up (to (6, 3)).
21. Move up (to (5, 3)).
22. Move up (to (4, 3)).
23. Move left (to (4, 2)).
24. Move left (to (3, 2)).
25. Move down (to (3, 1)).
26. Move down (to (4, 1)).
27. Move up (to (2, 0)).
28. Move right to (1, 0), then (1, 1) to reach 'E'.

Now, let's mark the path with `X`:

```
###########
#SXX# #  E#
# #X### # #
# #XXXXX# #
######### #
#       # #
# ####### #
#     # # #
##### ### #
# # #     #
###########
```

The above layout contains 'X' indicating the path taken from 'S' to 'E'. Note: The path may have different possible routes, and this is one of the traversable options following the maze rules.
