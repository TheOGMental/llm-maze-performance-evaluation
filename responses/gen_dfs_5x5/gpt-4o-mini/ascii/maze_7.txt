OUTPUT:
To solve the maze you provided and find a path from the starting point 'S' (which is located at (3,2)) to the endpoint 'E' (located at (4,2)), we can follow a systematic approach to navigate through the maze.

Here is the maze with coordinates for visual reference:

```
(0,0)###########(0,12)
(1,0)#   # # # #(1,12)
(2,0)# # #######(2,12)
(3,0)# #S# # # #(3,12)
(4,0)# # #######(4,12)
(5,0)# #E# # # #(5,12)
(6,0)# # #######(6,12)
(7,0)# # # # # #(7,12)
(8,0)# # # #####(8,12)
(9,0)###########(9,12)
```

Given the start position S (3,2) and the end position E (4,2), the steps to reach E from S are as follows:

1. **Starting at S (3,2)**
2. Move **down to (4,2)** - which is 'E'

Thus, the path is:

- Start at S (3,2)
- Move Down to E (4,2)

So the path from 'S' to 'E' is simply:
```
(3,2) -> (4,2)
```

This is a direct move down since there are no obstacles between 'S' and 'E'.
