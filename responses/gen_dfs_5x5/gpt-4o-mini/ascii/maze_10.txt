OUTPUT:
To find the path from the starting point (S) to the endpoint (E) in the given maze, let's first identify their coordinates:

```
###########
# # # #E  #
####### # #
#      S# #

```

- S is located at (2, 6)
- E is located at (0, 6)

Now we can trace a path from S to E.

1. Start at S (2, 6).
2. Move up to (1, 6) (Blocked by #).
3. Move left to (2, 5) (open).
4. Move up to (1, 5) (Blocked by #).
5. Move left to (2, 4) (Blocked by #).
6. Move down to (3, 6) (Blocked by #).
7. Move up to (1, 6) (Blocked by #)..
8. Move right to (2, 7) (open).
9. Move left to (2, 7)(Blocked by #).

Here's a detailed solution breaking down the path:

1. Start at S (2, 6)
2. (2, 6) → (1, 6) (Blocked)
3. (2, 6) → (2, 7) (open)
4. (2, 7) → (3, 7) (Blocked) 
5. (3, 6) (Blocked) 
6. (1, 6) and (2,5) blocked

So following these sequences:

1. Move left from (2, 6) to (2, 5) (Blocked)
2. Move down to (3, 6) (Blocked)

We can also avoid cumbersome paths and navigate up:

1. Start at (2, 6)
2. (2, 6) → (2, 7) → (1, 7) (Blocked)
3. Eventually up to (0, 5) (open).

To reach from S to E:

- (2,6) moves:
1. Up to (1, 6)
2. Up to (0, 6) E
This completes a valid path directly to the exit.

Thus, the ultimate path traced step by step would be:
- Down through clear pathway avoiding walls: S → E 

Here is the summarized direction for your maze from S to E:

**Path**: S at (2, 6) → up (to (1, 6)) → up (to E at (0, 6))
