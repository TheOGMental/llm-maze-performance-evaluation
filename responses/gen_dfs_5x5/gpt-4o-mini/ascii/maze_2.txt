OUTPUT:
To find a path from the start (S) to the end (E) in the provided maze, we can represent the solution using coordinates. The given maze is as follows:

```
###########
#    E    #
# ####### #
#S  #   # #
### # ### #
# # # #   #
##### # ###
# # # # # #
##### # ###
# # #   # #
###########
```

Here’s the breakdown of the path from S to E:

1. Start at (3, 0) (coordinates correspond to the row and column).
2. Move right to (3, 1).
3. Move up to (2, 1).
4. Move up to (1, 1).
5. Move left to (1, 2). This is actually not possible since it's blocked by walls. 
6. Instead, move to the right to (3, 2).
7. Move up to (2, 2).
8. Move further up to (1, 2).
9. Move to the right to (1, 3) which is also blocked.

Let's review the map for a viable path. The optimal path from S to E is as follows:

1. Start at (3, 1) - S
2. Move to (3, 2), move to (3, 3) (wall)
3. Move back to (3, 1), then S, move down continuously
4. Move up to (2, 1) and right to (1, 1) then finally reach E (1, 5).

Following these rules we find a logical step-by-step solution.

The actual path can be condensed here:
1. (3, 1) → (2, 1) up,  
2. (1, 1) left to (1, 2).
3. Finally, reach E at (1, 5).

Therefore, the path from Start to End can be represented as the movements through coordinates. 

Remember, any blocked pathway, I would need to backtrack and find alternate paths.

In textual instructions:

- Start at (3, 1)
- Move Up (2, 1)
- Move right (1, 1)
- Finally reach E.

This illustrates a path while getting around obstacles!
