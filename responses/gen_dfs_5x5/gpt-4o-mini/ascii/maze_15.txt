OUTPUT:
To solve the maze and find a path from the starting point (S) to the endpoint (E), I will provide a sequence of moves in the format of cardinal directions (U for up, D for down, L for left, R for right).

Here is the maze representation, showing 'S' as the start and 'E' as the end:

1. Start at S (3, 2)
2. Move Right (to (3, 3))
3. Move Right (to (3, 4))
4. Move Up (to (2, 4))
5. Move Up (to (1, 4))
6. Move Up (to (0, 4))
7. Move Right (to (0, 5))
8. Move Down (to (1, 5))
9. Move Down (to (2, 5))
10. Move Down (to (3, 5))
11. Move Right (to (3, 6))
12. Move Up (to (2, 6))
13. Move Up (to (1, 6))
14. Move Up (to (0, 6))
15. Move Right (to (0, 7))
16. Move Down (to (1, 7))
17. Move Down (to (2, 7))
18. Move Down (to (3, 7))
19. Move Right (to (3, 8))
20. Move Down (to (4, 8))
21. Move Down (to (5, 8))
22. Move Down (to (6, 8))
23. Move Left (to (6, 7))
24. Move Left (to (6, 6))
25. Move Left (to (6, 5))
26. Move Up (to (5, 5))
27. Move Up (to (4, 5))
28. Move Left (to (4, 4))
29. Move Up (to (3, 4))
30. Move Up (to (2, 4))
31. Move Left (to (2, 3))
32. Move Up (to (1, 3))
33. Move Up (to (0, 3))
34. Move Right (to (0, 4))
35. Move Right (to (0, 5))
36. Move Down (to (1, 5))
37. Move Down (to (2, 5))
38. Move Down (to (3, 5))
39. Move Right (to (3, 6))
40. Move Right (to (3, 7))
41. Move Right (to (3, 8))
42. Move Down (to (4, 8))
43. Move Down (to (5, 8))
44. Move Down (to (6, 8))
45. Move Left (to (6, 7))
46. Move Left (to (6, 6))
47. Move Up (to (5, 6))
48. Move Up (to (4, 6))
49. Move Up (to (3, 6))
50. Move Up (to (2, 6))
51. Move Up (to (1, 6))
52. Move Right (to (1, 7))
53. Move Right (to (1, 8))
54. Move Down (to (2, 8))
55. Move Down (to (3, 8))
56. Move Right (to (3, 9))
57. Move Down (to (4, 9))
58. Move Down (to (5, 9))
59. Move Down (to (6, 9))
60. Finally, you reach E!

This path may not be the only possible route but is one of the routes leading from S to E in the given maze configuration.
