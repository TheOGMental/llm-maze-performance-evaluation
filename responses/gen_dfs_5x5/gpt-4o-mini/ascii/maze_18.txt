OUTPUT:
To solve the maze and find a path from the starting point (S) to the end point (E), we can represent the maze as a coordinate grid, where each position can be referred to by its (row, column) coordinates.

The maze can be represented as follows, with 'S' as the start point at (2, 1) and 'E' as the end point at (2, 2):

```
###########
#   # # # #
# # #######
#S#E#     #
# ####### #
# #     # #
# # ### # #
#   # #   #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
```

Starting Point (S): (2, 1)  
Ending Point (E): (2, 2)  

To outline a path step-by-step from S to E:

1. Start at (2, 1) (S).
2. Move right to (2, 2) (E).

The path from S to E is straightforward as they are adjacent. Here's the representation of the moves:

- (2, 1) -> (2, 2)

Thus, the path from the start to the end is simply:

- **Path:** S â†’ E

This is the shortest path available through the maze.
