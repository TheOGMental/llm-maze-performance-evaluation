OUTPUT:
To navigate the provided maze from the starting position (S) to the exit (E), we will follow a systematic approach. The maze layout you provided looks like this:

```

# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
#E  #  S  #
# # ##### #
# #       #
###########
```

**Coordinates**: 
- Starting Point (S): (6, 5)
- Exit Point (E): (6, 1)

We can use standard notation for direction:
- Up = U (row - 1)
- Down = D (row + 1)
- Left = L (column - 1)
- Right = R (column + 1)

### Step-by-Step Pathfinding:

Starting from (6, 5):
1. Move Left to (6, 4): `L`
2. Move Left to (6, 3): `L`
3. Move Up to (5, 3): `U`
4. Move Up to (4, 3): `U`
5. Move Up to (3, 3): `U`
6. Move Up to (2, 3): `U`
7. Move Up to (1, 3): `U`
8. Move Up to (0, 3): `U`
9. Move Left to (0, 2): `L`
10. Move Down to (1, 2): `D`
11. Move Down to (2, 2): `D`
12. Move Down to (3, 2): `D`
13. Move Down to (4, 2): `D`
14. Move Down to (5, 2): `D`
15. Move Down to (6, 2): `D`
16. Move Left to (6, 1): `L` (reached Exit E)

### Final Path
The sequence of moves from S to E is:

```
L, L, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, L, D, D, D, D, D, D, L
```

Alternatively, represented as coordinates:

- Start at (6, 5)
- Move to (6, 4)
- Move to (6, 3)
- Up to (5, 3)
- Up to (4, 3)
- Up to (3, 3)
- Up to (2, 3)
- Up to (1, 3)
- Up to (0, 3)
- Left to (0, 2)
- Down to (1, 2)
- Down to (2, 2)
- Down to (3, 2)
- Down to (4, 2)
- Down to (5, 2)
- Down to (6, 2)
- Finally Left to Exit (6, 1)

### Conclusion
The complete path from the start (S) to the exit (E) while avoiding walls consists of the movements outlined above.
