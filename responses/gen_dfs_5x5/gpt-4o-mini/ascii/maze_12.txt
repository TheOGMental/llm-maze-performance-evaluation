OUTPUT:
To find a path from the starting point (S) to the endpoint (E) in the provided maze, we can trace the route step by step. 

Here's a representation of the maze with the designated start point (S) and end point (E):

```
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # #E    #  <-- E is at (6, 3)
# ### ### #
#     #S  #  <-- S is at (7, 6)
###########
```

We can navigate through the maze by identifying the available paths:

1. Start at S (7, 6).
2. Move up to (6, 6) - this cell is free.
3. Now move left to (6, 5) - this cell is still free.
4. Continue left to (6, 4) - this cell is also free.
5. Move left again to (6, 3) - you reach the endpoint E.

Now let's summarize the path as coordinates relative to the maze grid:

- **Starting Point (S): (7, 6)**
- Move to (6, 6)
- Move to (6, 5)
- Move to (6, 4)
- Move to (6, 3) â†’ **Endpoint (E)**

The coordinates of the path are:
1. (7, 6) S
2. (6, 6)
3. (6, 5)
4. (6, 4)
5. (6, 3) E

Thus, the path from S to E is as follows:

1. **From S: (Move Up) (7, 6) to (6, 6)**
2. **(Move Left) (6, 6) to (6, 5)**
3. **(Move Left) (6, 5) to (6, 4)**
4. **(Move Left) (6, 4) to (6, 3) - Reached E**

This successfully completes the route from S to E in the maze.
