OUTPUT:
To provide a path from the starting point (S) to the ending point (E) in the maze, first we identify their positions. In this case:

- Start (S) is located at (1, 5) (2nd row, 6th column).
- Exit (E) is located at (3, 5) (4th row, 6th column).

Hereâ€™s the path to navigate through the maze (with coordinates):

1. Start at (1, 5) [S]
2. Move down to (2, 5)
3. Move down to (3, 5) [E]

The full path is:
- Starting from (1, 5) (S), you move to (2, 5), then to (3, 5) (E).

Path in coordinates:
- (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5)

This is a clear and direct route from the start to the exit without any obstacles.
