OUTPUT:
To navigate the maze from the starting position 'S' to the target position 'E', we can represent the maze as a grid where walls are represented by '#' and open paths by spaces. 

Here is the maze representation with coordinates:
```
###########
#       # #  (1)
# ##### ###  (2)
#S#   #   #  (3)
# # # ### #  (4)
# # # #   #  (5)
# # # # ###  (6)
# # # #   #  (7)
# # ##### #  (8)
#E#       #  (9)
###########  (0)
```

The starting point 'S' is at (3, 0) and the end point 'E' is at (8, 0).

To find a path, I’ll list the moves (using (row, column) format) from 'S' to 'E':

1. Start at (3, 0)
2. Move down to (4, 0)
3. Move down to (5, 0)
4. Move down to (6, 0)
5. Move down to (7, 0)
6. Move down to (8, 0), where 'E' is located.

Thus, the path from 'S' to 'E' can be summarized as follows:
- (3, 0) → (4, 0) → (5, 0) → (6, 0) → (7, 0) → (8, 0)

The complete path in coordinate format is:

```
Start at S (3, 0)
Move to (4, 0)
Move to (5, 0)
Move to (6, 0)
Move to (7, 0)
Move to E (8, 0)
```

This path successfully navigates from the start to the exit within the constraints of the maze.
