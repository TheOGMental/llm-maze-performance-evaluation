INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (4,0) <--> NORTH (4,2) <--> NORTH (4,4) <--> NORTH (3,3) <--> WEST (3,3) <--> EAST (4,1) <--> WEST (4,2) <--> WEST (4,3) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (4,3) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,2) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (4,3) EAST (4,4) NORTH (3,4) WEST (3,3) WEST (3,2) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (4,3) to the target (3,2) in the given maze, we can analyze the adjacency list provided:

1. **Start at (4,3):**
   - Possible moves: WEST to (4,2) or EAST to (4,4).

2. **Choosing to move WEST to (4,2):**
   - From (4,2), possible moves: NORTH to (3,2) or WEST to (4,1) or EAST back to (4,3).
   - We can move NORTH to (3,2).

3. **Reaching the target (3,2):** 

The sequence of moves is:
- From (4,3) to (4,2) [WEST]
- From (4,2) to (3,2) [NORTH]

Thus, the complete path from origin to target is:

**Path:**
(4,3) WEST (4,2) NORTH (3,2) 

This is the desired path from (4,3) to (3,2).
