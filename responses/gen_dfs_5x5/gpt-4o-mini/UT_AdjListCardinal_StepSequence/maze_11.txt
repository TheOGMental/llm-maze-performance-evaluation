OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0,2) to the target (3,1) in the provided maze configuration, let's analyze the adjacency list and possible movements.

### Starting Point
- **Origin**: (0,2)

### Target Point
- **Target**: (3,1)

### Adjacent Moves
From (0,2), based on the adjacency list provided, the possible moves are:
- (0,2) --> (0,1) [WEST]
- (0,2) --> (1,2) [SOUTH]

Let's explore the movements:

1. **Move SOUTH to (1,2)**:
    - From (1,2), possible moves are:
        - (1,2) --> (0,2) [NORTH]
        - (1,2) --> (2,1) [SOUTH]
  
    Let's move further down to (2,1).
  
2. **Move SOUTH to (2,1)**:
    - From (2,1), possible moves are:
        - (2,1) --> (1,2) [NORTH]
        - (2,1) --> (3,2) [SOUTH] (Since moving down leads us the lowest in the maze)
    
    Let's move to (3,2).

3. **Move SOUTH to (3,2)**:
    - From (3,2), possible moves are:
        - (3,2) --> (2,1) [NORTH]
        - (3,2) --> (4,1) [SOUTH]

    We will take the next valid move. Letâ€™s go SOUTH to (4,1).

4. **Move SOUTH to (4,1)**:
    - From (4,1), possible moves are:
        - (4,1) --> (3,1) [NORTH]
        - (4,1) --> (4,2) (if it exists, but it's not listed as connected.)

Therefore, from (4,1), we can move NORTH to (3,1), which is our target.

### Final Path
Now we can summarize the moves as follows:
1. (0,2) SOUTH to (1,2)
2. (1,2) SOUTH to (2,1)
3. (2,1) SOUTH to (3,2)
4. (3,2) SOUTH to (4,1)
5. (4,1) NORTH to (3,1) [Target]

### Resulting Path
The complete path from origin (0,2) to target (3,1) is:
- **Path**: (0,2) SOUTH (1,2) SOUTH (2,1) SOUTH (3,2) SOUTH (4,1) NORTH (3,1)

This is a valid and connected path through the maze to reach the target.
