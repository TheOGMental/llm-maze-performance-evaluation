INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (0,1) <--> SOUTH (1,3) <--> NORTH (1,4) <--> NORTH (1,1) <--> SOUTH (1,2) <--> SOUTH (1,4) <--> SOUTH (3,0) <--> NORTH (3,2) <--> NORTH (2,3) <--> SOUTH (4,0) <--> NORTH (4,1) <--> NORTH (3,3) <--> SOUTH (0,4) <--> WEST (1,2) <--> EAST (2,0) <--> EAST (2,3) <--> EAST (3,2) <--> WEST (4,0) <--> EAST (4,2) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,1) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (0,4) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (0,1) SOUTH (1,1) SOUTH (2,1) WEST (2,0) SOUTH (3,0) SOUTH (4,0) EAST (4,1) NORTH (3,1) EAST (3,2) NORTH (2,2) NORTH (1,2) EAST (1,3) NORTH (0,3) EAST (0,4) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To navigate from the origin (0, 1) to the target (0, 4) based on the given adjacency list, we will construct a path step-by-step. 

Based on the adjacency information provided, here's a valid path:

1. Start at (0, 1)
2. Move SOUTH to (1, 1)
3. Move SOUTH to (1, 2)
4. Move EAST to (2, 2)
5. Move EAST to (2, 3)
6. Move NORTH to (1, 3)
7. Move NORTH to (1, 4)
8. Move NORTH to (0, 4)

Thus, the detailed path is:

<PATH_START>
(0, 1) SOUTH (1, 1) SOUTH (1, 2) EAST (1, 3) NORTH (0, 3) NORTH (0, 4)
<PATH_END>

Here's the simplified path representation:

<PATH_START>
(0, 1) SOUTH (1, 1) SOUTH (1, 2) EAST (2, 2) EAST (2, 3) NORTH (1, 3) NORTH (0, 4)
<PATH_END>
