INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,2) <--> NORTH (1,0) <--> SOUTH (3,0) <--> NORTH (3,1) <--> NORTH (3,2) <--> NORTH (3,3) <--> SOUTH (1,0) <--> EAST (1,1) <--> EAST (2,2) <--> WEST (3,0) <--> EAST (3,3) <--> WEST (4,1) <--> WEST (4,2) <--> WEST (4,2) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (1,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,2) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (1,0) EAST (1,1) EAST (1,2) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (1,0) to the target (1,2) in the given maze, we can analyze the adjacency list provided:

```
<ADJLIST_START>
(1,2) <--> NORTH (1,0)
<SOUTH (3,0) <--> NORTH (3,1) <--> NORTH (3,2) <--> NORTH (3,3) <--> 
<SOUTH (1,0) <--> EAST (1,1) <--> EAST (2,2) <--> WEST (3,0) <--> 
<EAST (3,3) <--> WEST (4,1) <--> WEST (4,2) <--> WEST (4,2) <--> EAST 
<ADJLIST_END>
```

The components of the maze indicate the following connections:

1. From (1,0), you can move to: 
   - (1,2) (NORTH)
   - (1,1) (EAST)

2. From (1,2), you can move to:
   - (1,0) (SOUTH)
   - (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) â€“ further connections (but irrelevant for this path)

Now let's take the shortest sequence of steps from the origin to the target:

Starting from (1,0):
1. Move **EAST** to (1,1).
2. Move **EAST** again to (1,2).

Hence, the complete path described in steps is:

```
<PATH_START>
(1,0) EAST (1,1) EAST (1,2)
<PATH_END>
```

Thus, the path from origin (1,0) to target (1,2) is valid and follows the connections provided in the adjacency list.
