INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,1) <--> NORTH (0,2) <--> SOUTH (0,4) <--> SOUTH (1,3) <--> SOUTH (3,3) <--> NORTH (3,4) <--> NORTH (4,3) <--> NORTH (4,4) <--> NORTH (0,2) <--> EAST (0,3) <--> EAST (1,2) <--> WEST (1,4) <--> WEST (4,3) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (2,4) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,4) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (2,4) SOUTH (3,4) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (2,4) to the target (3,4) in the given maze, we can follow the adjacency list provided.

Here's a possible step-by-step path:

1. Start at (2,4)
2. Move NORTH to (1,4)
3. Move WEST to (1,3)
4. Move SOUTH to (2,3)
5. Move SOUTH to (3,3)
6. Move NORTH to (3,4) - Target reached!

Thus, the complete path in directions (from origin to target) is:

**(2,4) SOUTH (2,3) SOUTH (3,3) NORTH (3,4)**

This results in the following path which effectively reaches the target:

1. **From (2,4) to (2,3)** (SOUTH)
2. **From (2,3) to (3,3)** (SOUTH)
3. **From (3,3) to (3,4)** (NORTH)

Therefore, the sequence of moves from the origin to the target is:

**(2,4) SOUTH (2,3) SOUTH (3,3) NORTH (3,4)**.
