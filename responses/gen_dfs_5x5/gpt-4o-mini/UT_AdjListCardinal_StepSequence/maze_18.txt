INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (0,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> SOUTH (1,0) <--> SOUTH (2,4) <--> NORTH (3,0) <--> NORTH (2,1) <--> SOUTH (3,3) <--> NORTH (2,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> WEST (1,2) <--> EAST (1,4) <--> WEST (2,2) <--> WEST (2,2) <--> EAST (3,1) <--> WEST (3,4) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (1,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,1) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (1,0) NORTH (0,0) EAST (0,1) SOUTH (1,1) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find the path from the origin (1,0) to the target (1,1) based on the provided adjacency list, we can trace through the connections.

Given the adjacency relationships:
1. Starting at **(1,0)**, we note that it can go **SOUTH** to **(2,0)**, but we need to evaluate other connections.
2. From **(1,0)**, the next move we are looking for is towards **(1,1)**.
3. We can observe that **(0,0)** is connected to **(0,1)** which is south, and then we can go from **(1,0)** to **(0,1)**.

Following the adjacency paths:

1. **Start at (1,0)**
2. **Move EAST to (1,1)**

Thus, the single step path from **(1,0)** to **(1,1)** is simply:

**Path:**
```
(1,0) EAST (1,1)
```

So, the completed path based on the given maze is:

**Resulting Path:**
```
(1,0) EAST (1,1)
```
