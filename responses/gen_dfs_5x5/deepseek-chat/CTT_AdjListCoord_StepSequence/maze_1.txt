OUTPUT:
Alright, let's tackle this maze step by step. I'll start by understanding the maze's layout based on the adjacency list provided, then figure out how to get from the origin `(2, 1)` to the target `(1, 4)`.

### Understanding the Maze Structure

First, let's list out all the connections (edges) between the cells (nodes) in the maze. Each `(x, y) <--> (a, b)` means you can move directly between cell `(x, y)` and cell `(a, b)`.

Here's the adjacency list broken down:

1. `(0, 2) <--> (0, 1)`
2. `(2, 0) <--> (2, 1)`
3. `(0, 3) <--> (0, 4)`
4. `(1, 4) <--> (1, 3)`
5. `(3, 0) <--> (2, 0)`
6. `(4, 1) <--> (3, 1)`
7. `(3, 3) <--> (3, 2)`
8. `(1, 2) <--> (1, 1)`
9. `(1, 2) <--> (1, 3)`
10. `(2, 3) <--> (3, 3)`
11. `(3, 0) <--> (4, 0)`
12. `(1, 1) <--> (1, 0)`
13. `(3, 1) <--> (3, 2)`
14. `(2, 4) <--> (2, 3)`
15. `(4, 1) <--> (4, 0)`
16. `(0, 3) <--> (0, 2)`
17. `(2, 4) <--> (1, 4)`
18. `(0, 0) <--> (1, 0)`
19. `(0, 0) <--> (0, 1)`

### Visualizing the Maze

To better understand, let's try to visualize the connections. Imagine a grid where the first number in the tuple is the row (increasing downward) and the second is the column (increasing to the right).

Here's how some cells are connected:

- From `(2,1)` (origin), we can go to `(2,0)`.
- From `(2,0)`, we can go to `(3,0)` or `(2,1)`.
- From `(3,0)`, we can go to `(4,0)` or `(2,0)`.
- From `(4,0)`, we can go to `(4,1)` or `(3,0)`.
- From `(4,1)`, we can go to `(3,1)` or `(4,0)`.
- From `(3,1)`, we can go to `(3,2)` or `(4,1)`.
- From `(3,2)`, we can go to `(3,3)` or `(3,1)`.
- From `(3,3)`, we can go to `(2,3)` or `(3,2)`.
- From `(2,3)`, we can go to `(2,4)` or `(3,3)`.
- From `(2,4)`, we can go to `(1,4)` (target) or `(2,3)`.

This seems like a possible path. Let's see if we can trace it step by step.

### Tracing the Path

Starting at `(2,1)`:

1. `(2,1)` → `(2,0)` (from adjacency 2)
2. `(2,0)` → `(3,0)` (from adjacency 5)
3. `(3,0)` → `(4,0)` (from adjacency 11)
4. `(4,0)` → `(4,1)` (from adjacency 15)
5. `(4,1)` → `(3,1)` (from adjacency 6)
6. `(3,1)` → `(3,2)` (from adjacency 13)
7. `(3,2)` → `(3,3)` (from adjacency 7)
8. `(3,3)` → `(2,3)` (from adjacency 10)
9. `(2,3)` → `(2,4)` (from adjacency 14)
10. `(2,4)` → `(1,4)` (from adjacency 17) → Target reached!

So, the path is:

`(2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,4)`

### Verifying for Shorter Paths

Is there a shorter path? Let's see if we can reach `(1,4)` without going all the way to `(4,0)`.

Alternative path attempt:

From `(2,1)`, can we go up or right? Adjacent to `(2,1)` is only `(2,0)` (from given adjacents), so no other immediate options.

Wait, let me check if `(2,1)` is connected to anything else. Looking at the adjacency list, only `(2,0) <--> (2,1)` is present, so `(2,1)` is only connected to `(2,0)`. So, the initial path seems necessary unless there's another way.

Is `(1,1)` connected to `(2,1)`? No, `(1,1)` is connected to `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, and `(0,1)` is connected to `(0,0)` and `(0,2)`, but no direct link from `(2,1)` to `(1,1)`.

Similarly, `(1,3)` is connected to `(1,2)` and `(1,4)`, but to reach `(1,3)`, we'd need to come from `(1,2)` or `(1,4)`. `(1,4)` is the target, so that's not helpful.

Thus, the initial path seems to be the only viable path given the connections.

### Final Path

After verifying, the shortest path from `(2,1)` to `(1,4)` is:

`(2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,4)`

### Representing the Path

Here's the path formatted as requested:

<PATH_START> ( 2 , 1 ) ( 2 , 0 ) ( 3 , 0 ) ( 4 , 0 ) ( 4 , 1 ) ( 3 , 1 ) ( 3 , 2 ) ( 3 , 3 ) ( 2 , 3 ) ( 2 , 4 ) ( 1 , 4 ) <PATH_END>
