OUTPUT:
To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin (0,0) to the target (1,3). Let's analyze the adjacency list and construct the path step by step.

### Adjacency List Analysis:
1. (1,0) <--> NORTH (1,1)
2. (1,1) <--> NORTH (0,2)
3. (0,2) <--> SOUTH (0,3)
4. (0,3) <--> SOUTH (0,4)
5. (0,4) <--> SOUTH (2,0)
6. (2,0) <--> NORTH (2,3)
7. (2,3) <--> NORTH (1,4)
8. (1,4) <--> SOUTH (3,1)
9. (3,1) <--> NORTH (2,2)
10. (2,2) <--> SOUTH (3,4)
11. (3,4) <--> NORTH (3,1)
12. (3,1) <--> SOUTH (4,2)
13. (4,2) <--> NORTH (3,3)
14. (3,3) <--> SOUTH (3,4)
15. (3,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1)
16. (0,1) <--> WEST (0,3)
17. (0,3) <--> EAST (1,1)
18. (1,1) <--> EAST (2,0)
19. (2,0) <--> EAST (2,2)
20. (2,2) <--> EAST (4,1)
21. (4,1) <--> EAST (4,4)
22. (4,4) <--> WEST

### Path Construction:
Starting at (0,0), we need to find a way to (1,3). However, (0,0) is not directly in the adjacency list, so we must find the closest connected point. The closest connected point to (0,0) is (1,0), which is directly south of (0,0).
