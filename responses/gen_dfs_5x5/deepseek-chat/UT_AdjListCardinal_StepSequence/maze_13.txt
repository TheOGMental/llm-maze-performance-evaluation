INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,2) <--> NORTH (0,4) <--> SOUTH (1,2) <--> SOUTH (1,4) <--> SOUTH (2,4) <--> SOUTH (4,2) <--> NORTH (0,2) <--> EAST (0,3) <--> EAST (3,2) <--> EAST (3,3) <--> EAST (4,2) <--> EAST (4,4) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,2) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,2) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (0,2) SOUTH (1,2) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0,2) to the target (1,2) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list step by step.

### Adjacency List Breakdown:
1. (1,2) is connected to:
   - NORTH: (0,4)
   - SOUTH: (1,4)
2. (0,4) is connected to:
   - SOUTH: (1,2)
3. (1,4) is connected to:
   - SOUTH: (2,4)
4. (2,4) is connected to: (no further connections listed)
5. (4,2) is connected to:
   - NORTH: (0,2) [This seems incorrect as (0,2) is not north of (4,2). Likely a typo, but we'll ignore this for now.]
6. (0,2) is connected to:
   - EAST: (0,3)
7. (0,3) is connected to:
   - EAST: (3,2) [This seems incorrect as (3,2) is not east of (0,3). Likely a typo, but we'll ignore this for now.]
8. (3,2) is connected to:
   - EAST: (3,3)
9. (3,3) is connected to:
   - EAST: (4,2)
10. (4,2) is connected to:
    - EAST: (4,4)
11. (4,4) is connected to:
    - WEST: (no further connections listed)

### Possible Path:
From the origin (0,2), the only immediate move is EAST to (0,3). However, (0,3) only connects EAST to (3,2), which seems incorrect spatially. This suggests the adjacency list may have errors or missing connections.

Assuming the adjacency list is correct as given, the only possible path is:
1. Start at (0,2).
2. Move EAST to (0,3).
3. From (0,3), move EAST to (3,2).
4. From (3,2), move EAST to (3,3).
5. From (3,3), move EAST to (4,2).
6. From (4,2), move EAST to (4,4).
7. From (4,4), move WEST (but this loops back to (4,2), which is not helpful).

This path does not reach the target (1,2). Thus, the maze as given has no valid path from (0,2) to (1,2) based on the provided adjacency list. 

### Likely Correct Path (Assuming Typos):
If we assume some connections are typos, a plausible path might be:
1. (0,2) -> SOUTH to (1,2) [if (0,2) had a SOUTH connection to (1,2), which it doesn't in the given list].
But this is not possible as per the given list.

### Conclusion:
The given adjacency list does not allow a valid path from (0,2) to (1,2). The list may be incomplete or contain errors. 

### Final Answer:
No valid path exists from (0,2) to (1,2) based on the provided adjacency list. 

However, if we assume the adjacency list is incomplete and (0,2) should connect SOUTH to (1,2), then the path would simply be:
- (0,2) SOUTH (1,2).

But this is not supported by the given data. 

Thus, the correct answer is: **No valid path exists with the given maze configuration.**
