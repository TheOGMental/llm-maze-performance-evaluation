EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (1,3) NORTH (0,3) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (1,3) to the target (0,3) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list and construct the path step by step.

### Adjacency List Analysis:
1. (0,3) is connected to: SOUTH (1,3)
2. (1,4) is connected to: NORTH (0,3), SOUTH (2,4)
3. (1,0) is connected to: SOUTH (2,0)
4. (2,4) is connected to: NORTH (1,4), SOUTH (3,4)
5. (2,1) is connected to: SOUTH (3,1)
6. (2,2) is connected to: SOUTH (3,2)
7. (3,3) is connected to: NORTH (2,3), SOUTH (4,3)
8. (3,4) is connected to: NORTH (2,4), SOUTH (4,4)
9. (3,1) is connected to: NORTH (2,1), SOUTH (4,1)
10. (4,2) is connected to: NORTH (3,2), SOUTH (5,2)
11. (4,3) is connected to: NORTH (3,3), SOUTH (5,3)
12. (4,4) is connected to: NORTH (3,4), SOUTH (5,4)
13. (0,4) is connected to: WEST (0,3)
14. (1,1) is connected to: WEST (1,0), EAST (1,2)
15. (1,3) is connected to: WEST (1,2), EAST (1,4)
16. (2,0) is connected to: WEST (1,0), EAST (2,1)
17. (4,2) is connected to: WEST (4,1), EAST (4,3)

### Path Construction:
Starting at the origin (1,3), we can move as follows:
1. From (1,3), move EAST to (1,4).
2. From (1,4), move NORTH to (0,4).
3. From (0,4), move WEST to (0,3), which is the target.

### Final Path:
(1,3) EAST (1,4) NORTH (0,4) WEST (0,3)

This path successfully goes from the origin (1,3) to the target (0,3).
