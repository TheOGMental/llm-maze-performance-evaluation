<ADJLIST_START> (0,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> SOUTH (1,0) <--> SOUTH (2,4) <--> NORTH (3,0) <--> NORTH (2,1) <--> SOUTH (3,3) <--> NORTH (2,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> WEST (1,2) <--> EAST (1,4) <--> WEST (2,2) <--> WEST (2,2) <--> EAST (3,1) <--> WEST (3,4) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (1,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,1) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (1,0) to the target (1,1) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list step by step.

### Adjacency List Analysis:
1. (0,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1)
2. (0,1) <--> SOUTH (1,0)
3. (1,0) <--> SOUTH (2,4)
4. (2,4) <--> NORTH (3,0)
5. (3,0) <--> NORTH (2,1)
6. (2,1) <--> SOUTH (3,3)
7. (3,3) <--> NORTH (2,4)
8. (2,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1)
9. (0,1) <--> WEST (1,2)
10. (1,2) <--> EAST (1,4)
11. (1,4) <--> WEST (2,2)
12. (2,2) <--> WEST (2,2) [self-loop, redundant]
13. (2,2) <--> EAST (3,1)
14. (3,1) <--> WEST (3,4)
15. (3,4) <--> WEST [no further connection, dead end]

### Path Construction:
We start at the origin (1,0). From the adjacency list:
- (1,0) is connected to (2,4) via SOUTH.
- (2,4) is connected to (0,1) via SOUTH.
- (0,1) is connected to (1,0) via SOUTH (which would loop us back, so we avoid this).
- (0,1) is also connected to (1,2) via WEST.
- (1,2) is connected to (1,4) via EAST.
- (1,4) is connected to (2,2) via WEST.
- (2,2) is connected to (3,1) via EAST.
- (3,1) is connected to (3,4) via WEST (dead end).

This path doesn't reach the target (1,1). Let's try another approach:

From (1,0):
- (1,0) is connected to (0,1) via NORTH (implied from (0,1) SOUTH (1,0)).
- (0,1) is connected to (1,2) via WEST.
- (1,2) is connected to (1,4) via EAST (not helpful).
- (0,1) is also connected to (1,0) via SOUTH (loop).

This also doesn't reach (1,1). 

### Correct Path:
From the adjacency list, (1,1) is not directly connected to any other cell, which suggests it might be isolated. However, since the target is (1,1) and the origin is (1,0), and (1,0) is connected to (0,1) and (2,4), but (1,1) isn't connected to anything, it seems impossible to reach the target from the origin in this maze configuration.

### Conclusion:
There is no valid path from (1,0) to (1,1) in the given maze because (1,1) is not connected to any other cell in the adjacency list. 

### Final Answer:
No valid path exists from (1,0) to (1,1) in the given maze configuration.
