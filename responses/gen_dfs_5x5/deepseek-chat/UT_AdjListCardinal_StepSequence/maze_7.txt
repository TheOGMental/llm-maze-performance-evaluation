OUTPUT:
To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin (1,1) to the target (2,1) using the given adjacency list. Let's analyze the connections step by step.

### Adjacency List:
- (1,0) <--> NORTH (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> NORTH (1,0)
- (1,0) <--> SOUTH (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> SOUTH (2,0)
- (2,0) <--> SOUTH (3,1)
- (3,1) <--> NORTH (3,0)
- (3,0) <--> SOUTH (4,1)
- (4,1) <--> NORTH (4,2)
- (4,2) <--> NORTH (0,0)
- (0,0) <--> EAST (4,2)
- (4,2) <--> WEST

### Origin: (1,1)
### Target: (2,1)

### Step-by-Step Path:
1. Start at (1,1).
2. From (1,1), the possible moves are:
   - NORTH to (1,0)
   - SOUTH to (2,0)
3. The target is (2,1), which is not directly connected to (1,1). However, (2,1) is adjacent to (2,0) (though not explicitly listed in the adjacency list, but assuming it's a typo and (2,0) should connect to (2,1)).
   - If (2,0) connects to (2,1), then:
     - From (1,1), go SOUTH to (2,0).
     - From (2,0), go NORTH to (2,1).

### Assumed Path:
- (1,1) SOUTH (2,0) NORTH (2,1)

However, since (2,1) is not explicitly connected to (2,0) in the given adjacency list, this path may not be valid. Alternatively, if (2,1) is not connected, then there is no valid path from (1,1) to (2,1) based on the given adjacency list.

### Re-evaluating the Adjacency List:
The adjacency list does not include (2,1), so it seems impossible to reach the target (2,1) from the origin (1,1) with the given connections. 

### Conclusion:
There is no valid path from (1,1) to (2,1) based on the provided adjacency list. The target (2,1) is not reachable from the origin (1,1). 

### Possible Correction:
If the adjacency list is incomplete and (2,0) should connect to (2,1), then the path would be:
- (1,1) SOUTH (2,0) NORTH (2,1)

But as given, the path does not exist. 

### Final Answer:
No valid path exists from (1,1) to (2,1) with the given adjacency list.
