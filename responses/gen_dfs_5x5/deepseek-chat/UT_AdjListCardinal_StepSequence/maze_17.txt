OUTPUT:
Alright, let's tackle this maze step by step. I'm going to approach this methodically to find a path from the origin `(4,4)` to the target `(4,2)` based on the given adjacency list.

### Understanding the Adjacency List

First, let's parse the adjacency list to understand how the cells are connected. The adjacency list shows which cells are connected to each other and in which direction.

Here's the adjacency list broken down:

1. `(1,4) <--> NORTH (2,0)`: From (1,4), you can go NORTH to (2,0), and vice versa.
2. `(2,0) <--> NORTH (1,1)`: From (2,0), NORTH to (1,1).
3. `(1,1) <--> SOUTH (2,2)`: From (1,1), SOUTH to (2,2).
4. `(2,2) <--> NORTH (3,0)`: From (2,2), NORTH to (3,0).
5. `(3,0) <--> NORTH (3,1)`: From (3,0), NORTH to (3,1).
6. `(3,1) <--> NORTH (2,4)`: From (3,1), NORTH to (2,4).
7. `(2,4) <--> SOUTH (3,0)`: From (2,4), SOUTH to (3,0).
8. `(3,0) <--> SOUTH (3,1)`: From (3,0), SOUTH to (3,1).
9. `(3,1) <--> SOUTH (4,2)`: From (3,1), SOUTH to (4,2).
10. `(4,2) <--> NORTH (3,3)`: From (4,2), NORTH to (3,3).
11. `(3,3) <--> SOUTH (3,4)`: From (3,3), SOUTH to (3,4).
12. `(3,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1)`: From (3,4), SOUTH to (0,1).
13. `(0,1) <--> EAST (0,2)`: From (0,1), EAST to (0,2).
14. `(0,2) <--> EAST (0,4)`: From (0,2), EAST to (0,4).
15. `(0,4) <--> WEST (1,0)`: From (0,4), WEST to (1,0).
16. `(1,0) <--> EAST (1,3)`: From (1,0), EAST to (1,3).
17. `(1,3) <--> WEST (1,4)`: From (1,3), WEST to (1,4).
18. `(1,4) <--> WEST (2,2)`: From (1,4), WEST to (2,2).
19. `(2,2) <--> EAST (2,3)`: From (2,2), EAST to (2,3).
20. `(2,3) <--> EAST (3,3)`: From (2,3), EAST to (3,3).
21. `(3,3) <--> WEST (4,1)`: From (3,3), WEST to (4,1).
22. `(4,1) <--> EAST (4,3)`: From (4,1), EAST to (4,3).
23. `(4,3) <--> EAST`: From (4,3), EAST to... (no cell specified, possibly a boundary).

### Identifying Origin and Target

- **Origin:** `(4,4)`
- **Target:** `(4,2)`

First, notice that `(4,4)` isn't directly listed in the adjacency list. This might mean it's isolated or there's a missing connection. However, looking at the adjacency list, the highest row number is 4 (e.g., `(4,1)`, `(4,2)`, `(4,3)`), but `(4,4)` isn't connected to any other cell based on the given list. This suggests that `(4,4)` might be a dead end with no exits, making it impossible to start from there.

But let's double-check if `(4,4)` is connected in any way. Scanning the adjacency list, there's no mention of `(4,4)` being connected to any other cell. Therefore, starting from `(4,4)`, we cannot move in any direction since there are no links from it.

### Verifying Possible Connections

Is there any cell that connects to `(4,4)`? Looking through the adjacency list:

- `(3,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1)`: This connects `(3,4)` to `(0,1)` via SOUTH, but not to `(4,4)`.
- `(4,3) <--> EAST`: It says EAST, but no cell is specified; it might imply `(4,4)`, but typically, EAST from `(4,3)` would be `(4,4)`, but since `(4,4)` isn't listed as connected back, this is ambiguous.

Given that `(4,4)` isn't listed in any connections, it's likely not part of the traversable maze, making the origin unreachable from any other point, and thus no path can start from `(4,4)`.

### Conclusion

Since the origin `(4,4)` is not connected to any other cell in the maze based on the provided adjacency list, there is no possible path from `(4,4)` to the target `(4,2)`.

### Final Answer

There is no possible path from the origin `(4,4)` to the target `(4,2)` because the origin cell `(4,4)` is not connected to any other cells in the maze.
