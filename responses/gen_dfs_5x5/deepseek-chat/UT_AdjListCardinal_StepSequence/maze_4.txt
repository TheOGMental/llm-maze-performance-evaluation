INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,1) <--> NORTH (0,4) <--> SOUTH (1,2) <--> SOUTH (1,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> WEST (0,2) <--> EAST (0,3) <--> EAST (1,2) <--> WEST (2,3) <--> WEST (2,3) <--> EAST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (2,3) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (0,0) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (2,3) WEST (2,2) NORTH (1,2) WEST (1,1) NORTH (0,1) WEST (0,0) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To solve this maze, we need to find a path from the origin (2,3) to the target (0,0). Let's analyze the adjacency list and construct the path step by step.

### Adjacency List Interpretation:
1. (1,1) <--> NORTH (0,4)
2. (0,4) <--> SOUTH (1,2)
3. (1,2) <--> SOUTH (1,4)
4. (1,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1)
5. (0,1) <--> WEST (0,2)
6. (0,2) <--> EAST (0,3)
7. (0,3) <--> EAST (1,2)
8. (1,2) <--> WEST (2,3)
9. (2,3) <--> WEST (2,3) (This seems like a self-loop or a typo; likely should connect to another cell)
10. (2,3) <--> EAST (This seems incomplete; likely should connect to another cell)

From the adjacency list, it seems there are some inconsistencies or missing connections. However, we can infer the following connections:
- (2,3) is connected to (1,2) via WEST.
- (1,2) is connected to (0,4), (1,4), and (0,3).
- (0,4) is connected to (1,1).
- (1,1) is connected to (0,4).
- (0,1) is connected to (0,2) and (1,4).
- (0,2) is connected to (0,3).
- (0,3) is connected to (1,2).

### Target (0,0):
The target (0,0) is not explicitly listed in the adjacency list, which suggests it might be isolated or unreachable. However, assuming there is a typo and (0,0) should be connected to one of the listed cells, the most likely candidate is (0,1), since (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1) via WEST.

### Constructing the Path:
Assuming (0,0) is connected to (0,1) via WEST, here's a possible path:
1. Start at (2,3).
2. Move WEST to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), move SOUTH to (1,4).
4. From (1,4), move SOUTH to (0,1).
5. From (0,1), move WEST to (0,0).

However, (0,1) is connected to (0,2) via WEST, not (0,0). This suggests (0,0) is unreachable from the given adjacency list. 

### Alternative Interpretation:
If (0,0) is a typo and the intended target is (0,1), the path would be:
1. (2,3) WEST (1,2) SOUTH (1,4) SOUTH (0,1).

But since the target is explicitly (0,0), and it's not in the adjacency list, the maze as given has no valid path to the target. 

### Final Answer:
Given the provided adjacency list, the target (0,0) is unreachable from the origin (2,3). The adjacency list does not include (0,0) or any connections leading to it. 

If there is a typo and the target is (0,1), the path is:
<PATH_START> (2,3) WEST (1,2) SOUTH (1,4) SOUTH (0,1) <PATH_END>.

Otherwise, no valid path exists to (0,0). 

For the given problem, assuming (0,0) is unreachable, the answer is:
"No valid path exists from (2,3) to (0,0) with the given adjacency list." 

If you can confirm or correct the adjacency list or target, I can provide a more accurate path. 

### Possible Corrected Path (assuming (0,0) is connected to (0,1)):
If we assume (0,0) is connected to (0,1) via WEST (even though not in the adjacency list), the path would be:
<PATH_START> (2,3) WEST (1,2) SOUTH (1,4) SOUTH (0,1) WEST (0,0) <PATH_END>.

But this is speculative without confirmation of the adjacency list. 

Given the strict constraints, the answer is:
"No valid path exists to (0,0) as it is not in the adjacency list."
