OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0,1) to the target (0,4) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list and construct a valid path step by step.

### Adjacency List Analysis:
1. (0,1) is connected to: SOUTH (1,1)
2. (1,1) is connected to: SOUTH (1,2), NORTH (0,1)
3. (1,2) is connected to: SOUTH (1,4), EAST (2,2), NORTH (1,1)
4. (1,4) is connected to: SOUTH (3,0), NORTH (1,2), NORTH (1,3)
5. (1,3) is connected to: NORTH (0,1), NORTH (1,4)
6. (2,2) is connected to: WEST (1,2)
7. (2,3) is connected to: SOUTH (4,3), EAST (3,3), NORTH (1,3)
8. (3,0) is connected to: NORTH (1,4), EAST (3,2)
9. (3,2) is connected to: NORTH (2,3), WEST (3,0), EAST (4,2)
10. (3,3) is connected to: SOUTH (4,3), WEST (2,3)
11. (4,0) is connected to: NORTH (3,0), EAST (4,1)
12. (4,1) is connected to: NORTH (3,3), WEST (4,0), EAST (4,2)
13. (4,2) is connected to: WEST (3,2), EAST (4,1)
14. (0,4) is connected to: WEST (1,4)

### Path Construction:
We start at (0,1) and aim to reach (0,4). Here's a possible path:

1. From (0,1), go SOUTH to (1,1).
2. From (1,1), go SOUTH to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), go EAST to (2,2).
4. From (2,2), go WEST back to (1,2) (this seems redundant, so let's try another route).
   
   Alternatively:
   
   From (1,2), go SOUTH to (1,4).
   From (1,4), go NORTH to (1,3).
   From (1,3), go NORTH to (0,1) (back to origin, not helpful).
   
   Another attempt:
   
   From (1,2), go SOUTH to (1,4).
   From (1,4), the only other option is SOUTH to (3,0), which seems far from the target.

   Let's try a different approach:

1. From (0,1), go SOUTH to (1,1).
2. From (1,1), go SOUTH to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), go EAST to (2,2).
4. From (2,2), the only connection is WEST back to (1,2). This is a dead end.

   Another approach:

1. From (0,1), go SOUTH to (1,1).
2. From (1,1), go SOUTH to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), go SOUTH to (1,4).
4. From (1,4), go NORTH to (1,3).
5. From (1,3), go NORTH to (0,1) (back to start).

This seems like a loop. The only other connection from (1,4) is SOUTH to (3,0), which doesn't help.

   Let's try:

1. From (0,1), go SOUTH to (1,1).
2. From (1,1), go SOUTH to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), go SOUTH to (1,4).
4. From (1,4), go SOUTH to (3,0).
5. From (3,0), go EAST to (3,2).
6. From (3,2), go NORTH to (2,3).
7. From (2,3), go EAST to (3,3).
8. From (3,3), go SOUTH to (4,3).
   This seems to be moving away from the target.

### Correct Path:
After analyzing the connections, here's a valid path:

1. From (0,1), go SOUTH to (1,1).
2. From (1,1), go SOUTH to (1,2).
3. From (1,2), go SOUTH to (1,4).
4. From (1,4), go WEST to (0,4).

This path is valid because:
- (1,4) is connected to (0,4) via WEST.

### Final Path:
(0,1) SOUTH (1,1) SOUTH (1,2) SOUTH (1,4) WEST (0,4)
