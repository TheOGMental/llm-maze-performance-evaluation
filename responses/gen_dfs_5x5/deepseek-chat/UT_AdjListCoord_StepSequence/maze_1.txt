<ADJLIST_START> (2,0) <--> (2,1) ; (3,3) <--> (2,3) ; (0,0) <--> (1,0) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,3) ; (0,1) <--> (0,0) ; (2,4) <--> (2,3) ; (1,4) <--> (1,3) ; (3,0) <--> (4,0) ; (3,2) <--> (3,1) ; (1,2) <--> (1,1) ; (4,1) <--> (4,0) ; (1,4) <--> (2,4) ; (0,2) <--> (0,1) ; (0,3) <--> (0,4) ; (4,1) <--> (3,1) ; (1,2) <--> (1,3) ; (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (1,0) <--> (1,1) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (2,1) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,4) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (2,1) (2,0) (3,0) (4,0) (4,1) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (2,3) (2,4) (1,4) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (2,1) to the target (1,4) in the given maze, we can follow these steps using the adjacency list provided:

1. Start at (2,1).
2. From (2,1), the adjacent cells are (2,0) (since (2,0) <--> (2,1) is in the adjacency list).
3. From (2,0), the adjacent cells are (3,0) and (1,0) (since (3,0) <--> (2,0) and (1,0) <--> (2,0) are in the adjacency list).
4. From (1,0), the adjacent cells are (0,0) and (1,1) (since (0,0) <--> (1,0) and (1,0) <--> (1,1) are in the adjacency list).
5. From (1,1), the adjacent cells are (1,0) and (1,2) (since (1,0) <--> (1,1) and (1,2) <--> (1,1) are in the adjacency list).
6. From (1,2), the adjacent cells are (1,1) and (1,3) (since (1,2) <--> (1,1) and (1,2) <--> (1,3) are in the adjacency list).
7. From (1,3), the adjacent cells are (1,2) and (1,4) (since (1,2) <--> (1,3) and (1,4) <--> (1,3) are in the adjacency list).
8. From (1,4), we have reached the target.

Here is the path from (2,1) to (1,4):

(2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4)

This path follows the adjacency list and successfully reaches the target. 

Final Answer:
<PATH_START> (2,1) (2,0) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) <PATH_END>
