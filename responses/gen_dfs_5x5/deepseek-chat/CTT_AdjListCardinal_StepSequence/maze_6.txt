OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (1, 3) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list and construct a valid path step by step.

### Adjacency List Analysis:
1. (0, 0) is connected to:
   - SOUTH to (1, 1)
   - EAST to (0, 4)

2. (1, 1) is connected to:
   - NORTH to (0, 0)
   - NORTH to (1, 2)

3. (1, 2) is connected to:
   - NORTH to (0, 3)
   - WEST to (1, 2) [This seems like a self-loop, likely a typo. Assuming it's a typo and ignoring.]

4. (0, 3) is connected to:
   - SOUTH to (1, 4)

5. (1, 4) is connected to:
   - NORTH to (0, 3)
   - NORTH to (2, 0)

6. (2, 0) is connected to:
   - NORTH to (1, 4)

7. (1, 3) is connected to:
   - SOUTH to (2, 4)

8. (2, 4) is connected to:
   - NORTH to (1, 3)
   - NORTH to (3, 1)

9. (3, 1) is connected to:
   - NORTH to (2, 4)
   - NORTH to (2, 2)

10. (2, 2) is connected to:
    - SOUTH to (3, 4)
    - EAST to (2, 1)
    - WEST to (2, 2) [Self-loop, likely a typo. Ignoring.]

11. (3, 4) is connected to:
    - NORTH to (2, 2)
    - NORTH to (4, 1)

12. (4, 1) is connected to:
    - NORTH to (3, 4)
    - NORTH to (4, 2)
    - EAST to (4, 3)

13. (4, 2) is connected to:
    - NORTH to (4, 1)

14. (3, 3) is connected to:
    - SOUTH to (4, 4)

15. (4, 4) is connected to:
    - NORTH to (3, 3)

16. (0, 4) is connected to:
    - WEST to (0, 0)

17. (2, 1) is connected to:
    - WEST to (2, 2)

18. (4, 3) is connected to:
    - EAST to (4, 1)

### Path Construction:
We start at (0, 0) and aim to reach (1, 3). Here's one possible path:

1. From (0, 0), go SOUTH to (1, 1).
2. From (1, 1), go NORTH to (1, 2).
3. From (1, 2), go NORTH to (0, 3).
4. From (0, 3), go SOUTH to (1, 4).
5. From (1, 4), go NORTH to (2, 0).
6. From (2, 0), there are no outgoing edges that lead closer to (1, 3). This path seems stuck.

Let's try another path:

1. From (0, 0), go EAST to (0, 4).
2. From (0, 4), go WEST to (0, 0). This loops back, so not helpful.

Alternative approach: From (0, 0), go SOUTH to (1, 1), then NORTH to (1, 2), then NORTH to (0, 3), then SOUTH to (1, 4), then NORTH to (2, 0). This seems to loop and not reach (1, 3).

Another attempt:
1. From (0, 0), go SOUTH to (1, 1).
2. From (1, 1), go NORTH to (1, 2).
3. From (1, 2), go WEST to (2, 1). [Assuming (1, 2) has WEST to (2, 1) based on adjacency list.]
4. From (2, 1), go WEST to (2, 2).
5. From (2, 2), go SOUTH to (3, 4).
6. From (3, 4), go NORTH to (2, 2). This loops.

This maze seems tricky. Let's try:
1. From (0, 0), go SOUTH to (1, 1).
2. From (1, 1), go NORTH to (1, 2).
3. From (1, 2), go NORTH to (0, 3).
4. From (0, 3), go SOUTH to (1, 4).
5. From (1, 4), go NORTH to (2, 0).
6. From (2, 0), no progress.

It seems the maze may not have a valid path from (0, 0) to (1, 3) based on the given adjacency list. However, let's try one more path:

1. From (0, 0), go SOUTH to (1, 1).
2. From (1, 1), go NORTH to (1, 2).
3. From (1, 2), go NORTH to (0, 3).
4. From (0, 3), go SOUTH to (1, 4).
5. From (1, 4), go NORTH to (2, 0).
6. From (2, 0), no outgoing edges lead to (1, 3).

### Conclusion:
After exploring all possible paths, it appears there is no valid path from the origin (0, 0) to the target (1, 3) in the given maze configuration based on the provided adjacency list. The maze may be unsolvable as given, or there may be missing or incorrect connections in the adjacency list. 

### Final Answer:
No valid path exists from (0, 0) to (1, 3) in the given maze configuration.
