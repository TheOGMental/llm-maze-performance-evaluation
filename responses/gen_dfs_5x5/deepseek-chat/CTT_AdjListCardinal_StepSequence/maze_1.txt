OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (2, 1) to the target (1, 4) in the given maze, we need to explore the adjacency list and determine a sequence of moves that connects these two points. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Adjacency List Analysis:
First, let's list out the connections from the adjacency list for clarity:

- (1, 0) <--> NORTH (2, 4)
- (2, 4) <--> NORTH (3, 0)
- (3, 0) <--> NORTH (2, 3)
- (2, 3) <--> SOUTH (3, 0)
- (3, 0) <--> SOUTH (3, 1)
- (3, 1) <--> SOUTH (0, 1)
- (0, 1) <--> WEST (0, 1)
- (0, 1) <--> EAST (0, 2)
- (0, 2) <--> EAST (0, 4)
- (0, 4) <--> WEST (1, 1)
- (1, 1) <--> WEST (1, 2)
- (1, 2) <--> WEST (1, 2)
- (1, 2) <--> EAST (1, 4)
- (1, 4) <--> WEST (2, 0)
- (2, 0) <--> EAST (2, 3)
- (2, 3) <--> EAST (3, 2)
- (3, 2) <--> WEST (3, 2)
- (3, 2) <--> EAST (4, 1)
- (4, 1) <--> WEST

### Starting Point: (2, 1)
The origin is at (2, 1), but this point is not directly listed in the adjacency list. This means we need to find a nearby point that can connect to (2, 1). However, since (2, 1) is not connected to any other point in the adjacency list, it seems there might be an issue with the maze configuration or the origin point. 

Assuming that (2, 1) is connected to some nearby point (e.g., (2, 0) or (2, 3)), let's proceed with the closest available connections.

### Possible Path:
1. From (2, 1), we can move to (2, 0) (assuming a connection exists, though not in the adjacency list).
2. From (2, 0), go EAST to (2, 3).
3. From (2, 3), go EAST to (3, 2).
4. From (3, 2), go WEST back to (3, 2) (this seems redundant, so perhaps skip this step).
5. From (3, 2), go EAST to (4, 1).
6. From (4, 1), there is no further connection, so this path doesn't lead to the target.

Alternative Path:
1. From (2, 1), move to (1, 1) (assuming a connection exists).
2. From (1, 1), go WEST to (1, 2).
3. From (1, 2), go EAST to (1, 4), which is the target.

However, (1, 1) is connected to (1, 2), and (1, 2) is connected to (1, 4), so this seems viable if we can get from (2, 1) to (1, 1).

### Final Path:
Given the constraints, the most plausible path is:
1. (2, 1) -> (1, 1) (assuming a SOUTH move, though not explicitly listed)
2. (1, 1) WEST (1, 2)
3. (1, 2) EAST (1, 4)

But since (2, 1) is not connected in the adjacency list, this maze may not have a valid path from the given origin to the target with the provided connections.

### Conclusion:
Given the adjacency list, there is no valid path from (2, 1) to (1, 4) because (2, 1) is not connected to any other point in the maze. The maze configuration may be incomplete or incorrect. 

If we assume that (2, 1) is connected to (1, 1), then the path would be:
<PATH_START> (2, 1) SOUTH (1, 1) WEST (1, 2) EAST (1, 4) <PATH_END>

However, since the adjacency list does not include (2, 1), this path is not valid based on the given data. Thus, the maze has no solution with the provided information.
