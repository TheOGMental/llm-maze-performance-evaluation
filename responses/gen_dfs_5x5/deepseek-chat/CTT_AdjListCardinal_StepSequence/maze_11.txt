INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> ( 0 , 0 ) <--> SOUTH ( 0 , 2 ) <--> SOUTH ( 2 , 1 ) <--> NORTH ( 2 , 2 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 0 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 2 ) <--> NORTH ( 4 , 1 ) <--> NORTH ( 4 , 2 ) <--> NORTH ( 0 , 1 ) <--> WEST ( 0 , 2 ) <--> WEST ( 1 , 1 ) <--> WEST ( 2 , 0 ) <--> EAST ( 4 , 2 ) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> ( 0 , 2 ) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> ( 3 , 1 ) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (0, 2) to the target (3, 1) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list and explore possible routes step by step.

### Adjacency List Representation:
- (0, 0) <--> SOUTH (0, 2)
- (0, 2) <--> SOUTH (2, 1)
- (2, 1) <--> NORTH (2, 2)
- (2, 2) <--> NORTH (3, 0)
- (3, 0) <--> NORTH (3, 2)
- (3, 2) <--> NORTH (4, 1)
- (4, 1) <--> NORTH (4, 2)
- (0, 1) <--> WEST (0, 2)
- (1, 1) <--> WEST (2, 0)
- (2, 0) <--> EAST (4, 2)
- (4, 2) <--> WEST

### Observations:
1. The target (3, 1) is not directly listed in the adjacency list, which suggests it might be isolated or unreachable. However, let's assume it's adjacent to one of the listed nodes (e.g., (3, 0) or (3, 2)) even though it's not explicitly connected in the given adjlist.
2. From the origin (0, 2), we can move SOUTH to (2, 1).
3. From (2, 1), we can move NORTH to (2, 2).
4. From (2, 2), we can move NORTH to (3, 0).
5. From (3, 0), we can move NORTH to (3, 2).
6. From (3, 2), we can move NORTH to (4, 1).
7. From (4, 1), we can move NORTH to (4, 2).
8. From (4, 2), we can move WEST to (2, 0).
9. From (2, 0), we can move EAST back to (4, 2), which creates a loop without reaching (3, 1).

### Alternative Path:
Since (3, 1) is not directly reachable from any node in the adjacency list, there is no valid path from (0, 2) to (3, 1) based on the given connections. 

### Conclusion:
The target (3, 1) is unreachable from the origin (0, 2) in the provided maze configuration. 

### Final Answer:
No valid path exists from (0, 2) to (3, 1) in the given maze. 

If the adjacency list is incomplete or (3, 1) is meant to be connected to another node (e.g., (3, 0) or (3, 2)), please provide the corrected adjacency list for further assistance.
