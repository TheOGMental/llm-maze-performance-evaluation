<ADJLIST_START> ( 4 , 0 ) <--> NORTH ( 3 , 1 ) <--> SOUTH ( 3 , 4 ) <--> SOUTH ( 3 , 1 ) <--> WEST ( 3 , 3 ) <--> WEST ( 3 , 3 ) <--> EAST ( 4 , 2 ) <--> WEST ( 4 , 2 ) <--> EAST ( 4 , 4 ) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> ( 3 , 3 ) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> ( 3 , 0 ) <TARGET_END>

<PATH_START> ( 3 , 3 ) EAST ( 3 , 4 ) SOUTH ( 4 , 4 ) WEST ( 4 , 3 ) WEST ( 4 , 2 ) WEST ( 4 , 1 ) NORTH ( 3 , 1 ) WEST ( 3 , 0 ) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
To find a path from the origin (3, 3) to the target (3, 0) in the given maze, let's analyze the adjacency list step by step.

### Adjacency List:
1. (4, 0) <--> NORTH (3, 0)
2. (3, 1) <--> SOUTH (4, 1) [Note: (4, 1) is not in the list, so this seems disconnected or invalid]
3. (3, 4) <--> SOUTH (4, 4)
4. (3, 1) <--> WEST (3, 0)
5. (3, 3) <--> WEST (3, 2) [Note: (3, 2) is not in the list, so this seems disconnected or invalid]
6. (3, 3) <--> EAST (3, 4)
7. (4, 2) <--> WEST (4, 1) [Note: (4, 1) is not in the list, so this seems disconnected or invalid]
8. (4, 2) <--> EAST (4, 3) [Note: (4, 3) is not in the list, so this seems disconnected or invalid]
9. (4, 4) <--> WEST (4, 3) [Note: (4, 3) is not in the list, so this seems disconnected or invalid]

### Valid Connections:
From the adjacency list, the valid connections are:
- (3, 3) <--> EAST (3, 4)
- (3, 4) <--> SOUTH (4, 4)
- (3, 1) <--> WEST (3, 0)
- (4, 0) <--> NORTH (3, 0)

### Path Construction:
1. Start at the origin: (3, 3)
2. From (3, 3), move EAST to (3, 4)
3. From (3, 4), move SOUTH to (4, 4)
   - At this point, we are stuck because (4, 4) has no other connections.
4. Alternatively, from (3, 3), there are no other valid moves except EAST to (3, 4), which leads to a dead end.

### Re-evaluating:
It seems the maze is not fully connected, and there is no valid path from (3, 3) to (3, 0) based on the given adjacency list. However, if we assume that (3, 1) is connected to (3, 0) via WEST, but (3, 1) is not reachable from (3, 3), then the path is impossible.

### Possible Correction:
If there is a missing connection, such as (3, 3) <--> WEST (3, 2) and (3, 2) <--> WEST (3, 1), then the path could be:
1. (3, 3) WEST (3, 2)
2. (3, 2) WEST (3, 1)
3. (3, 1) WEST (3, 0)

But since (3, 2) and its connections are not in the adjacency list, this is not valid.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided adjacency list, there is no valid path from (3, 3) to (3, 0). The maze is either incomplete or incorrectly specified.

### Final Answer:
No valid path exists from (3, 3) to (3, 0) in the given maze configuration.
