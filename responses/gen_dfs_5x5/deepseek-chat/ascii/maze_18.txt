OUTPUT:
To solve the given maze, we need to find a path from the origin `S` (start) to the target `E` (end). Here's the maze for reference:

```
###########
#   # # # #
# # #######
#S#E#     #
# ####### #
# #     # #
# # ### # #
#   # #   #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Start (`S`) and End (`E`) Positions:**
   - `S` is located at the 4th row, 2nd column (assuming the top-left corner is (1,1)).
   - `E` is located at the 4th row, 4th column.

2. **Possible Moves:**
   - From `S` (4,2), you can move:
     - Up to (3,2)
     - Down to (5,2)
     - Left to (4,1) (but this is a wall `#`)
     - Right to (4,3) (but this is a wall `#`)

3. **Exploring Moves:**
   - From `S` (4,2), moving up to (3,2):
     - (3,2) is a wall `#`, so this is invalid.
   - From `S` (4,2), moving down to (5,2):
     - (5,2) is a wall `#`, so this is invalid.
   - From `S` (4,2), moving left to (4,1) is a wall.
   - From `S` (4,2), moving right to (4,3) is a wall.

   Wait a minute, this suggests that `S` is completely blocked, which contradicts the presence of `E` in the maze. Let me re-examine the maze.

   Upon closer inspection, `S` is at (4,2), and `E` is at (4,4). The positions around `S`:
   - (4,1): `#` (wall)
   - (4,3): `#` (wall)
   - (3,2): `#` (wall)
   - (5,2): `#` (wall)

   This implies `S` is entirely surrounded by walls, making it impossible to reach `E`. This seems like an unsolvable maze or possibly a misplacement of `S` or `E`.

4. **Rechecking Maze Layout:**
   Let me re-express the maze with coordinates for clarity (rows and columns):

   Row 1: `###########`
   Row 2: `#   # # # #`
   Row 3: `# # #######`
   Row 4: `#S#E#     #`
   Row 5: `# ####### #`
   Row 6: `# #     # #`
   Row 7: `# # ### # #`
   Row 8: `#   # #   #`
   Row 9: `###########`
   Row 10: `# # # # # #`
   Row 11: `###########`

   - `S` is at Row 4, Column 2.
   - `E` is at Row 4, Column 4.
   - Adjacent to `S`:
     - Left: Row 4, Column 1 is `#` (wall)
     - Right: Row 4, Column 3 is `#` (wall)
     - Up: Row 3, Column 2 is `#` (wall)
     - Down: Row 5, Column 2 is `#` (wall)

   This confirms that `S` is entirely blocked by walls, making it impossible to start moving. Therefore, the maze is unsolvable as given.

### Conclusion:
The maze is unsolvable because the start position `S` is completely surrounded by walls (`#`), leaving no possible moves to reach `E`. There might be an error in the maze configuration (e.g., `S` or `E` placed incorrectly). 

If the maze is correct as given, then there is no valid path from `S` to `E`. 

### Corrected Maze (Assuming Possible Misplacement):
If `S` were at (4,1) instead of (4,2), the maze would be solvable. For example:

```
###########
#   # # # #
# # #######
#SE#     #
# ####### #
# #     # #
# # ### # #
#   # #   #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
```

In this case, `S` is at (4,1) and `E` at (4,2), and the path is simply right from `S` to `E`:
- Path: (4,1) â†’ (4,2)

But as given, the maze is unsolvable. 

### Final Answer:
The maze is unsolvable because the start position `S` is entirely blocked by walls, leaving no possible moves to reach `E`.
