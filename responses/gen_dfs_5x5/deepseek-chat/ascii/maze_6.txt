OUTPUT:
To solve the given maze, we'll find a path from the origin `S` to the target `E`. Here's the maze for reference:

```
###########
#S  # #   #
# # # # # #
# #   #E# #
# ##### # #
#   #   # #
### # ### #
# # # # # #
### # # # #
# #   #   #
###########
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Starting Position (`S`)**:
   - Located at the top-left part of the maze: (1, 1).

2. **Movement Options from `S`**:
   - From `S`, you can move right or down.
   - Moving right: (1, 2) and (1, 3) are open.
   - Moving down: (2, 1) is blocked by a wall (`#`), so you cannot go down initially.

3. **Path Exploration**:
   - Move right to (1, 2) and then to (1, 3).
   - From (1, 3), you can move down to (2, 3).
   - From (2, 3), move down to (3, 3).
   - From (3, 3), move right to (3, 4) and then to (3, 5).
   - At (3, 5), you can see `E` (the target) at (3, 7), but there's a wall at (3, 6), so you cannot go directly right.
   - Instead, from (3, 5), move down to (4, 5), but (4, 5) is a wall (`#`), so this path is blocked.
   - Go back to (3, 3) and move down to (4, 3), but (4, 3) is a wall.
   - Go back to (2, 3) and move down to (3, 3) again, then realize this is a loop.
   - Alternative: From (1, 3), move down to (2, 3), then down to (3, 3), then down to (4, 3) (blocked), so this path is invalid.
   - Alternative: From `S`, move down to (2, 1) is blocked, so only right is possible.

4. **Alternative Path**:
   - From `S` (1, 1), move right to (1, 2) and (1, 3).
   - From (1, 3), move down to (2, 3).
   - From (2, 3), move down to (3, 3).
   - From (3, 3), move right to (3, 4) and (3, 5).
   - From (3, 5), move down to (4, 5) (blocked), so this path is invalid.
   - Instead, from (3, 3), move down to (4, 3) (blocked), so this path is invalid.
   - From (3, 3), move left to (3, 2), then down to (4, 2), which is open.
   - From (4, 2), move down to (5, 2).
   - From (5, 2), move right to (5, 3) and (5, 4).
   - From (5, 4), move up to (4, 4) (blocked by `#`), so move down to (6, 4).
   - From (6, 4), move right to (6, 5) and (6, 6).
   - From (6, 6), move up to (5, 6), then right to (5, 7).
   - From (5, 7), move up to (4, 7), then up to (3, 7), which is `E`.

### Final Path:
The correct path from `S` to `E` is:
1. Right to (1, 2)
2. Right to (1, 3)
3. Down to (2, 3)
4. Down to (3, 3)
5. Left to (3, 2)
6. Down to (4, 2)
7. Down to (5, 2)
8. Right to (5, 3)
9. Right to (5, 4)
10. Down to (6, 4)
11. Right to (6, 5)
12. Right to (6, 6)
13. Up to (5, 6)
14. Right to (5, 7)
15. Up to (4, 7)
16. Up to (3, 7) (`E`)

### Path Representation:
The path can be represented as a sequence of coordinates:
(1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (6,4) → (6,5) → (6,6) → (5,6) → (5,7) → (4,7) → (3,7).

### Visual Path:
Here’s the maze with the path marked as `P`:

```
###########
#SPP# #   #
# #P# # # #
# #PPP#E# #
# ##### # #
#   #   # #
### # ### #
# # # # # #
### # # # #
# #   #   #
###########
```

The path successfully navigates from `S` to `E`.
