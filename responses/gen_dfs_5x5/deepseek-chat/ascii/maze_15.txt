OUTPUT:
To solve the given maze, we need to find a path from the origin `S` (start) to the target `E` (end). Here's the maze for reference:

```

# # # # # #
##### #####
#S   E# # #
# #########
# #   # # #
# # # #####
#   #   # #
####### ###
#       # #
###########
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Start (`S`) and End (`E`) Positions:**
   - `S` is located at the 4th row, 2nd column (assuming the top-left corner is (1,1)).
   - `E` is located at the 4th row, 6th column.

2. **Possible Moves:**
   - From `S`, you can move right, left, up, or down as long as the path is not blocked by a wall (`#`).

3. **Path Exploration:**
   - From `S` (4,2), you can move right to (4,3), then right again to (4,4), and then right to (4,5). 
   - At (4,5), you can move right to reach `E` at (4,6).

This is a straightforward path since there are no obstructions between `S` and `E` on the same row.

### Path:
The path from `S` to `E` is: 
- Right (from (4,2) to (4,3))
- Right (from (4,3) to (4,4))
- Right (from (4,4) to (4,5))
- Right (from (4,5) to (4,6) where `E` is located).

### Visual Representation of the Path:

```

The path is a straight line to the right from `S` to `E`.
