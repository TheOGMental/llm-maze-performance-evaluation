OUTPUT:
To solve the given maze, we need to find a path from the origin `S` (start) to the target `E` (end). Here's the maze for reference:

```
###########
# # #S    #
##### ### #
# # #E# # #
##### ### #
# # # # # #
######### #
# # #     #
##### #####
# # #     #
###########
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Start (`S`) and End (`E`) Positions:**
   - `S` is located at the 3rd column of the 2nd row.
   - `E` is located at the 5th column of the 4th row.

2. **Possible Moves:**
   - From `S`, you can move `Right`, `Left`, `Up`, or `Down` as long as the path is not blocked by a wall (`#`).

3. **Path Exploration:**
   - From `S` (2nd row, 3rd column), the possible moves are:
     - Right: 4th column is empty (valid).
     - Left: 2nd column is a wall (blocked).
     - Up: 1st row is a wall (blocked).
     - Down: 3rd row, 3rd column is a wall (blocked).
   - So, the only initial move is `Right` to (2nd row, 4th column).

4. **Continue Moving Right:**
   - From (2nd row, 4th column), you can continue moving `Right` until you hit a wall or reach `E`.
   - Moves:
     - Right to (2nd row, 5th column).
     - Right to (2nd row, 6th column).
     - Right to (2nd row, 7th column) — wall at (2nd row, 8th column), so cannot go further right.

5. **From (2nd row, 7th column), Possible Moves:**
   - Right: wall (blocked).
   - Left: back to (2nd row, 6th column) — not helpful.
   - Up: (1st row, 7th column) is a wall (blocked).
   - Down: (3rd row, 7th column) is empty (valid).

6. **Move Down to (3rd row, 7th column):**
   - From here, `E` is at (4th row, 5th column), so we need to move left and down.
   - Possible moves:
     - Left to (3rd row, 6th column).
     - Right to (3rd row, 8th column) — wall (blocked).
     - Up: back to (2nd row, 7th column) — not helpful.
     - Down: (4th row, 7th column) is empty (valid).

7. **Move Down to (4th row, 7th column):**
   - From here, `E` is at (4th row, 5th column), so we need to move left.
   - Possible moves:
     - Left to (4th row, 6th column).
     - Left to (4th row, 5th column) — this is `E`.

### Final Path:
The path from `S` to `E` is:
1. Right to (2, 4)
2. Right to (2, 5)
3. Right to (2, 6)
4. Right to (2, 7)
5. Down to (3, 7)
6. Down to (4, 7)
7. Left to (4, 6)
8. Left to (4, 5) — `E`

### Path in Coordinates (row, column):
- (2, 3) → (2, 4) → (2, 5) → (2, 6) → (2, 7) → (3, 7) → (4, 7) → (4, 6) → (4, 5)

### Visualized Path:
```
###########
# # #S....#
##### ###.#
# # #E# #.#
##### ###.#
# # # # # #
######### #
# # #     #
##### #####
# # #     #
###########
```
(Here, the path is marked with `.` for clarity, though the original maze does not show these.) 

### Directions:
- Right (to 2,4)
- Right (to 2,5)
- Right (to 2,6)
- Right (to 2,7)
- Down (to 3,7)
- Down (to 4,7)
- Left (to 4,6)
- Left (to 4,5) — `E`
