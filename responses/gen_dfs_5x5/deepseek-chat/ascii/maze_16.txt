OUTPUT:
To solve the given maze, we need to find a path from the origin `S` (Start) to the target `E` (End). Here's the maze for reference:

```

#S  # #  E#
# # ### # #

```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Start at `S` (Position: (1,1))**: 
   - From `S`, you can move right or down. Moving right seems more promising as it leads towards the center of the maze.

2. **Move Right to (1,2)**:
   - From (1,2), you can continue right to (1,3) or move down to (2,2). Moving right to (1,3) is a dead end (surrounded by walls), so move down to (2,2).

3. **Move Down to (2,2)**:
   - From (2,2), you can move down to (3,2) or left to (2,1). Moving left to (2,1) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move down to (3,2).

4. **Move Down to (3,2)**:
   - From (3,2), you can move right to (3,3) or down to (4,2). Moving right to (3,3) leads to an open path.

5. **Move Right to (3,3)**:
   - From (3,3), you can move right to (3,4) or down to (4,3). Moving right to (3,4) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move down to (4,3).

6. **Move Down to (4,3)**:
   - From (4,3), you can move left to (4,2) or down to (5,3). Moving left to (4,2) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move down to (5,3).

7. **Move Down to (5,3)**:
   - From (5,3), you can move right to (5,4) or down to (6,3). Moving right to (5,4) leads to an open path.

8. **Move Right to (5,4)**:
   - From (5,4), you can move right to (5,5) or down to (6,4). Moving right to (5,5) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move down to (6,4).

9. **Move Down to (6,4)**:
   - From (6,4), you can move left to (6,3) or down to (7,4). Moving left to (6,3) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move down to (7,4).

10. **Move Down to (7,4)**:
    - From (7,4), you can move left to (7,3), right to (7,5), or down to (8,4). Moving right to (7,5) leads towards `E`.

11. **Move Right to (7,5)**:
    - From (7,5), you can move right to (7,6) or up to (6,5). Moving right to (7,6) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move up to (6,5).

12. **Move Up to (6,5)**:
    - From (6,5), you can move right to (6,6) or up to (5,5). Moving right to (6,6) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move up to (5,5).

13. **Move Up to (5,5)**:
    - From (5,5), you can move left to (5,4) or up to (4,5). Moving left to (5,4) is backtracking, so move up to (4,5).

14. **Move Up to (4,5)**:
    - From (4,5), you can move left to (4,4) or up to (3,5). Moving left to (4,4) is a dead end (blocked by a wall), so move up to (3,5).

15. **Move Up to (3,5)**:
    - From (3,5), you can move right to (3,6) or up to (2,5). Moving right to (3,6) leads towards `E`.

16. **Move Right to (3,6)**:
    - From (3,6), you can move right to (3,7) or up to (2,6). Moving right to (3,7) is the position of `E`.

17. **Move Right to `E` (3,7)**:
    - You have reached the target.

### Final Path:
The path from `S` to `E` is as follows (coordinates are in (row, column) format, starting from (1,1) at the top-left corner):

1. (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (6,4) → (7,4) → (7,5) → (6,5) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (3,6) → (3,7)

### Visual Representation of the Path:
Here’s the maze with the path marked as `P`:

```
###########
#SPP# #  E#
#P# ### # #
#P#     #P#
#########P#
#       #P#
# #######P#
#     # #P#
##### ###P#
# # #     #
###########
```

The path moves right from `S`, then down, right, down, right, down, right, down, right, up, up, up, right, and finally right to `E`.
