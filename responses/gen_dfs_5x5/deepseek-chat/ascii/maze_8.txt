OUTPUT:
Alright, let's tackle this maze step by step. I'll start by understanding the layout of the maze and then try to find a path from the origin 'S' to the target 'E'.

### Understanding the Maze

First, let's represent the maze in a more readable grid format with rows and columns labeled for easier reference. Here's the given maze:

```
###########
# # #     #
# ### #####
# # #     #
# ####### #
#E# # # # #
# ####### #
# # #   # #
# ### # # #
#S    #   #
###########
```

Let's assign row numbers from top to bottom (1 to 10) and column numbers from left to right (1 to 11):

```
Row 1: ###########
Row 2: # # #     #
Row 3: # ### #####
Row 4: # # #     #
Row 5: # ####### #
Row 6: #E# # # # #
Row 7: # ####### #
Row 8: # # #   # #
Row 9: # ### # # #
Row 10:#S    #   #
Row 11:###########
```

Now, let's identify the positions:
- 'S' (Start) is at Row 10, Column 2.
- 'E' (End) is at Row 6, Column 2.

### Maze Representation

Let's represent the maze as a grid where '#' is a wall and ' ' (space) is a path. 'S' and 'E' are also part of the path.

### Finding the Path

We'll use a method where we explore possible moves from 'S' to 'E', keeping track of visited positions to avoid loops. Possible moves are up, down, left, right (no diagonals).

Starting at S (Row 10, Col 2).

**Current Position:** (10, 2)

Possible moves from (10,2):
- Up: (9,2) - '#', wall, can't go.
- Down: (11,2) - '#', wall, can't go.
- Left: (10,1) - '#', wall, can't go.
- Right: (10,3) - ' ', path.

Move right to (10,3).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3)

**Current Position:** (10,3)

Possible moves from (10,3):
- Up: (9,3) - ' ', path.
- Down: (11,3) - '#', wall.
- Left: (10,2) - 'S', visited.
- Right: (10,4) - ' ', path.

Options: up or right. Let's try up to (9,3).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (9,3)

**Current Position:** (9,3)

Possible moves from (9,3):
- Up: (8,3) - '#', wall.
- Down: (10,3) - visited.
- Left: (9,2) - '#', wall.
- Right: (9,4) - '#', wall.

Dead end. Backtrack to (10,3).

**Current Position:** (10,3)

Next option from (10,3): right to (10,4).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4)

- Up: (9,4) - '#', wall.
- Down: (11,4) - '#', wall.
- Left: (10,3) - visited.
- Right: (10,5) - ' ', path.

Move right to (10,5).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5)

**Current Position:** (10,5)

Possible moves from (10,5):
- Up: (9,5) - ' ', path.
- Down: (11,5) - '#', wall.

- Up: (8,7) - visited.
- Down: (10,7) - '#', wall.
- Left: (9,6) - '#', wall.
- Right: (9,8) - ' ', path.

Move right to (9,8).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5) -> (9,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,8)

**Current Position:** (9,8)

Possible moves from (9,8):
- Up: (8,8) - ' ', path.
- Down: (10,8) - ' ', path.
- Left: (9,7) - visited.
- Right: (9,9) - '#', wall.

Options: up or down. Let's try up to (8,8).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5) -> (9,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (8,8)

- Down: (9,8) - visited.
- Left: (8,7) - visited.
- Right: (8,9) - '#', wall.

Dead end. Backtrack to (9,8).

**Current Position:** (9,8)

Next option from (9,8): down to (10,8).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5) -> (9,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (10,8)

**Current Position:** (10,8)

Possible moves from (10,8):
- Up: (9,8) - visited.
- Down: (11,8) - '#', wall.
- Left: (10,7) - '#', wall.
- Right: (10,9) - ' ', path.

Move right to (10,9).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5) -> (9,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (10,8) -> (10,9)

**Current Position:** (10,9)

- Up: (9,9) - '#', wall.
- Down: (11,9) - '#', wall.
- Left: (10,8) - visited.
- Right: (10,10) - ' ', path.

Move right to (10,10).

**Path so far:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5) -> (9,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (10,8) -> (10,9) -> (10,10)

**Current Position:** (10,10)

Possible moves from (10,10):
- Up: (9,10) - '#', wall.
- Down: (11,10) - '#', wall.
- Left: (10,9) - visited.
- Right: (10,11) - '#', wall.

Dead end. Backtrack to (10,9), then (10,8), then (9,8), then (9,7), then (8,7), then (8,6), then (8,5), then (9,5), then (10,5), then (10,4), then (10,3), then (10,2).

This seems like we're going in circles. Maybe we need to try a different initial path.

### Alternative Path Attempt

From the start (10,2), let's try moving right as before but take different turns.

From (10,3), instead of going up to (9,3), let's go right to (10,4), then (10,5), then up to (9,5), then up to (8,5), then left to (8,4), which is a dead end, then right to (8,6), then right to (8,7), then up to (7,7) - but (7,7) is a wall. So down to (9,7), then right to (9,8), then up to (8,8), dead end, then down to (10,8), right to (10,9), right to (10,10), dead end.

Hmm, seems similar. Maybe we need to go up earlier.

From (10,5), instead of up to (9,5), let's go right to (10,6).

**Path:** (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (10,4) -> (10,5) -> (10,6)

From (10,6):
- Up: (9,6) - '#', wall.
- Down: (11,6) - '#', wall.
- Left: (10,5) - visited.
- Right: (10,7) - '#', wall.

Dead end. So that's not helpful.

### Trying Another Approach

Let me look at the maze again. Maybe from 'S', go right to (10,3), then up to (9,3), then left is wall, right is wall, up is wall, down is visited. Dead end.

Only other option from (10,3) is right to (10,4), then (10,5), then up to (9,5), then up to (8,5), then left to (8,4) dead end, right to (8,6), then right to (8,7), then down to (9,7), right to (9,8), up to (8,8) dead end, down to (10,8), right to (10,9), right to (10,10) dead end.

Seems like we're stuck. Maybe the path involves going up from (9,5) to (8,5), then right to (8,6), then up to (7,6) - but (7,6) is a wall. 

Wait, looking at row 7: `# ####### #`. The only open is (7,2) where 'E' is. Maybe we need to reach (7,2) from above.

From (8,5), can we go up to (7,5)? (7,5) is '#'. No.

From (8,6), up is (7,6) - '#'. No.

From (8,7), up is (7,7) - '#'. No.

From (9,7), up is (8,7). Already there.

From (9,8), up is (8,8), which is a dead end.

Hmm, seems like we can't reach 'E' from the bottom. Maybe 'E' is at (6,2), which is above. Let me see if we can go up from (8,5) to (7,5) - no, wall.

Wait, row 6: `#E# # # # #`. 'E' is at (6,2). 

From (8,5), can we go left to (8,4), then up to (7,4) - (7,4) is '#'. No.

From (8,3) is '#'. 

Seems like the only way to 'E' is from (6,1) or (6,3). (6,1) is '#', (6,3) is ' '.

So need to reach (6,3). 

From (5,3): (5,3) is '#'. 

From (4,3): (4,3) is ' '. 

From (4,2): '#'. From (4,4): ' '.

From (3,3): '#'. From (3,4): ' '.

From (2,3): ' '. From (2,4): ' '.

From (1,3): '#'. 

So path from top: (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) is wall. 

Not connecting to 'E'. 

Alternative from (4,3) -> (4,2) is wall. 

Seems like 'E' is isolated. Maybe the maze is unsolvable, but that can't be since it's labeled as solved.

Wait, maybe 'E' is accessible from (6,1) - but (6,1) is '#'. 

From (6,3): can we reach from bottom? 

From (8,3): '#'. 

From (7,3): '#'. 

From (6,3): ' '. 

From (5,3): '#'. 

From (4,3): ' '. 

From (3,3): '#'. 

From (2,3): ' '. 

From (1,3): '#'. 

So path from top: (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) is wall. 

No path from bottom to (6,3). 

Wait, maybe 'E' is at (6,2), and we can reach from (6,1) or (6,3). (6,1) is '#', (6,3) is ' '. 

From (6,3), can we reach from bottom? 

From (7,3): '#'. 

From (8,3): '#'. 

From (9,3): ' '. 

From (10,3): ' '. 

From (10,2): 'S'. 

So path: (10,2) -> (10,3) -> (9,3) -> (8,3) is wall. 

From (9,3), can go up to (8,3) - wall. 

From (9,3), left is (9,2) - '#', right is (9,4) - '#'. 

Dead end. 

Thus, 'E' at (6,2) is only adjacent to (6,3), which is not reachable from 'S'. 

Therefore, the maze appears to be unsolvable as 'E' is isolated from 'S'. 

But since it's labeled as solved, maybe I misread 'E' position. 

Looking again, 'E' is at Row 6, Column 2. 

Adjacent to 'E':
- (6,1): '#'
- (6,3): ' '
- (5,2): '#'
- (7,2): '#'

Only (6,3) is accessible. 

Now, can we reach (6,3)?

From bottom:
(10,3) -> (9,3) -> dead end.

From top:
(2
