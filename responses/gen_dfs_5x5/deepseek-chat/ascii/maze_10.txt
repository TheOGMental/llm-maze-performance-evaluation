OUTPUT:
To solve the given maze, we need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E). Here's the maze for reference:

```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Positions:**
   - **Origin (S):** Located at the 4th row, 8th column (assuming the top-left is (1,1)).
   - **Target (E):** Located at the 2nd row, 8th column.

2. **Possible Moves:**
   - From S (4,8), you can move: Left, Right, Up, or Down if the adjacent cell is not a wall (#).

3. **Pathfinding:**
   - From S (4,8), move **Left** to (4,7).
   - From (4,7), move **Left** to (4,6).
   - From (4,6), move **Left** to (4,5).
   - From (4,5), move **Left** to (4,4).
   - From (4,4), move **Left** to (4,3).
   - From (4,3), move **Left** to (4,2).
   - From (4,2), move **Up** to (3,2).
   - From (3,2), move **Up** to (2,2).
   - From (2,2), move **Right** to (2,3).
   - From (2,3), move **Right** to (2,4).
   - From (2,4), move **Right** to (2,5).
   - From (2,5), move **Right** to (2,6).
   - From (2,6), move **Right** to (2,7).
   - From (2,7), move **Right** to (2,8) (E).

### Path:
The path from S to E is as follows (using coordinates (row, column)):

(4,8) → (4,7) → (4,6) → (4,5) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (2,6) → (2,7) → (2,8)

### Directions:
- Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right.

This path successfully navigates from the origin (S) to the target (E) without hitting any walls.
