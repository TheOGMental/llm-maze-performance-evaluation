OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (4, 1) and the target is at (0, 3).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (4, 1), the cell is connected to (3, 1) and (4, 2). The target (0, 3) is connected to (0, 2) and (0, 4).

## 3: Explore paths from the origin
Starting from (4, 1), we can move to (3, 1) or (4, 2). Let's explore both options to find a path to the target.

## 4: Explore the path through (3, 1)
Moving from (4, 1) to (3, 1), we can then move to (3, 0) or (3, 2) or (4, 1) back to the origin, but (3, 2) seems promising as it connects to (2, 2) and (3, 3).

## 5: Continue exploring through (3, 2)
From (3, 2), moving to (2, 2) and then to (2, 3) or (1, 2). From (2, 2) to (3, 2) and (2, 3) could lead to (2, 4) which connects to (1, 4) and (0, 4) is close to the target area.

## 6: Explore the path through (4, 2)
From (4, 2), we can move to (4, 1) back to the origin, or to (4, 3). (4, 3) connects to (4, 4) and (4, 2), and (4, 4) connects to (3, 4) which could lead to (0, 4).

## 7: Find a path to the target (0, 3)
Let's focus on a promising path: From (4, 1) to (4, 2) to (4, 3) to (4, 4) to (3, 4) to (3, 3) to (3, 2) to (0, 2) or directly find a connection to (0,3). Noticing (0, 3) is connected to (0, 2) and (0, 4), and (0, 4) is connected to (1, 4) which is connected to (2, 4) and (2, 4) is connected to (3, 4). However, a more direct approach seems feasible through (1,1) to (0,1) then to (0,2) or (0,3) if directly connected.

## 8: Detailed path exploration
A potential path could be: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) is not directly helpful. Instead, consider (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3).

## 9: Verify the path
Let's verify this path: (4,1) to (4,2) is a valid move. (4,2) to (4,3) is valid. (4,3) to (4,4) is valid. (4,4) to (3,4) is valid. (3,4) to (3,3) is valid. (3,3) to (3,2) is valid. (3,2) to (2,2) is valid. (2,2) to (1,2) is valid. (1,2) to (0,2) is valid. (0,2) to (0,3) is valid.

## 10: Write down the path
The path from (4,1) to (0,3) is: (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3)}$
