OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (1, 0) and the target is at (0, 2).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (1, 0), the cell is connected to (1, 1) and (0, 0). The target is at (0, 2), which is connected to (0, 1) and (0, 3).

## 3: Explore paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (1, 0), we can move to (1, 1) or (0, 0). We need to find a path that leads to (0, 2).

## 4: Analyze the connection from (1, 1)
From (1, 1), we can move to (2, 1) or (1, 0) or (1, 2). Moving to (1, 2) seems promising as it could lead to (0, 2) through (0, 1) or directly if connected.

## 5: Analyze the connection from (0, 0)
From (0, 0), we can move to (0, 1) or (1, 0). Since (0, 1) is directly connected to (0, 2), this path seems very promising.

## 6: Explore the path through (0, 0) to (0, 1) to (0, 2)
- From (1, 0), move to (0, 0).
- From (0, 0), move to (0, 1).
- From (0, 1), move to (0, 2).

## 7: Verify the path
The path from (1, 0) to (0, 0) to (0, 1) to (0, 2) seems direct and valid based on the given connections.

## 8: Write down the path
The path is: (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 0) (0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2)}$
