OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (3, 1) and the target is at (1, 4).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (3, 1), the cell is connected to (3, 2) and (2, 1). The target (1, 4) is connected to (0, 4) and (2, 4).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin
Starting from (3, 1), we can move to (3, 2) or (2, 1). Let's explore both options to see if we can reach the target.

## 4: Explore the path through (3, 2)
From (3, 2), we can move to (2, 2) or (3, 3) or (3, 1). Moving to (2, 2) allows us to connect to (1, 2) or (2, 3). We need to find a path that leads towards (1, 4).

## 5: Explore the path through (2, 1)
From (2, 1), we can move to (2, 0) or (3, 1) or (1, 1). From (1, 1), we can move to (0, 1) or (1, 0) or (2, 1). We should look for connections that get us closer to (1, 4).

## 6: Find a path to the target
Let's try to move towards the target by exploring connections systematically:
- From (3, 1), moving to (2, 1) then to (1, 1).
- From (1, 1), we can move to (0, 1) or (1, 0) or (2, 1). Let's try (0, 1) which connects to (0, 2) and (1, 1).
- From (0, 1) to (0, 2) which connects to (0, 1) or (1, 2) or (2, 2).
- However, a more direct approach seems feasible: from (3, 1) to (3, 2) to (2, 2) to (1, 2) doesn't directly lead to (1, 4) but let's correct the approach by systematically finding a path.

## 7: Systematic approach to find the path
A systematic approach involves using a search algorithm like BFS or DFS. However, given the constraints, let's manually trace a feasible path:
- (3, 1) to (3, 2)
- (3, 2) to (2, 2)
- (2, 2) to (1, 2)
- (1, 2) to (0, 2) or directly try to get closer to (1,4)
- Noticing (1, 4) is connected to (0, 4) and (2, 4), let's try to get to (2, 4) or (0, 4).

## 8: Direct path exploration
Exploring directly:
- (3, 1) to (2, 1)
- (2, 1) to (2, 0)
- (2, 0) to (3, 0)
- (3, 0) to (4, 0)
- (4, 0) to (4, 1)
- (4, 1) to (4, 2)
- (4, 2) to (4, 3)
- (4, 3) to (4, 4)
- (4, 4) to (3, 4)
- (3, 4) to (2, 4)
- (2, 4) to (1, 4)

## 9: Construct the path
The path from (3, 1) to (1, 4) is: (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 4) (3, 4) (2, 4) (1, 4)}$
