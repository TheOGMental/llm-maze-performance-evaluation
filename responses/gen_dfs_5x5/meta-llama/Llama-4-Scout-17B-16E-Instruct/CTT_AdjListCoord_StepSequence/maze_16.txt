OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (0,4).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (0,0), the cell (0,1) and (1,0) are accessible. The target is at (0,4), which is connected to (1,4) and (0,3).

## 3: Explore paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (0,0), we can move to (0,1) or (1,0). Let's explore both paths to see if we can reach (0,4).

## 4: Path exploration from (0,0) to (0,1)
From (0,1), we can move to (1,1) or (0,0). Moving to (1,1) seems promising as it might connect to other paths leading to the target.

## 5: Continue path exploration from (1,1)
From (1,1), we can move to (1,2) or (0,1). Let's move to (1,2).

## 6: Further path exploration from (1,2)
From (1,2), we can move to (1,1) or (1,3). Moving to (1,3) seems promising.

## 7: Path exploration from (1,3)
From (1,3), we can move to (0,3) or (1,2). Let's move to (0,3).

## 8: Path exploration from (0,3)
From (0,3), we can move to (0,4) or (1,3). Moving to (0,4) directly reaches the target.

## 9: Construct the path from origin to target
The path from (0,0) to (0,4) can be constructed as: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,4).

## 10: Verify the path
Let's verify that this path is correct and follows the given adjacency list:
- (0,0) is connected to (0,1) and (1,0).
- (0,1) is connected to (1,1) and (0,0).
- (1,1) is connected to (1,2) and (0,1).
- (1,2) is connected to (1,1) and (1,3).
- (1,3) is connected to (0,3) and (1,2).
- (0,3) is connected to (1,3) and (0,4).
- (0,4) is the target.

The final answer is: 
(0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4)
