OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (4, 3) and the target is at (3, 2).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (4, 3), the cell is connected to (3, 4) and (4, 4). The target is at (3, 2), which is connected to (3, 3) and (4, 2).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (4, 3), we can move to (4, 4) or (3, 4). From (4, 4), we can move to (4, 3), (4, 1) is not directly accessible from (4, 4) without backtracking, but (3, 4) and (4, 3) are directly connected. From (3, 4), we can move to (3, 3) or (4, 4).

## 4: Find a path to the target
Let's explore a path:
- From (4, 3), move to (3, 4).
- From (3, 4), move to (3, 3).
- From (3, 3), move to (3, 2).

This path seems direct and efficient.

## 5: Verify the path
The proposed path is: (4, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2). Let's verify it matches the given connections:
- (4, 3) is connected to (3, 4) and (4, 4).
- (3, 4) is connected to (3, 3) and (4, 4).
- (3, 3) is connected to (3, 2) and (3, 4).

## 6: Confirm the solution
The path (4, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) is valid according to the provided adjacency list.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 3) (3, 2)}$
