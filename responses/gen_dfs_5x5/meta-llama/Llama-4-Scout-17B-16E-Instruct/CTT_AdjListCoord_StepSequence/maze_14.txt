OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (3, 3) and the target is at (3, 0).

## 2: Identify the connections of the origin and target
From the origin (3, 3), the connected cells are (3, 2) and (3, 4). The target (3, 0) is connected to (3, 1) and (4, 0).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (3, 3), we can move to (3, 2) or (3, 4). We need to find a path that leads to (3, 0).

## 4: Analyze the connection to (3, 2)
If we move to (3, 2), the connected cells are (3, 3) and (3, 1). Moving to (3, 1) is a possible next step, as it connects to (3, 0) and (4, 1).

## 5: Find a path through (3, 1) to (3, 0)
From (3, 1), we can directly move to (3, 0), which is the target. So, one possible path is (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0).

## 6: Verify if the path is valid and optimal
The path (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0) seems direct and valid. Let's verify if there are no shorter paths. Since we are moving in a grid-like structure represented by an adjacency list, and given the connections, moving directly down from (3,3) to (3,0) is not possible because there are no direct connections between (3,3) and (3,0) or any cell that would allow a straight vertical path.

## 7: Consider alternative paths for comparison
An alternative path could involve moving to (3, 4) first, then to (4, 4), and navigating from there. However, given the connections, moving to (3, 4) then to (4, 4) then to (4, 3) then to (4, 2) then to (4, 1) then to (3, 1) then to (3, 0) would be longer: (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0).

## 8: Choose the most efficient path
The most direct path found is (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3) (3, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0)}$
