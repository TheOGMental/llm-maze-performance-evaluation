OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (0, 2) and the target is at (3, 1).

## 2: Identify the connections from the origin
From (0, 2), we can move to (0, 1) or (1, 2) since these are the adjacent cells according to the given adjacency list.

## 3: Explore the possible paths from the origin to the target
Let's start exploring paths:
- From (0, 2), we can go to (0, 1) or (1, 2).
- If we go to (0, 1), we can then move to (0, 0) or (1, 1).
- If we go to (1, 2), we can then move to (0, 2) or (2, 2).

## 4: Continue exploring paths to find a route to the target (3, 1)
Continuing from the previous step:
- From (0, 1), moving to (0, 0) doesn't seem helpful as it doesn't connect to (3, 1) directly or indirectly in a straightforward manner without backtracking.
- From (0, 1), moving to (1, 1) is possible, and from (1, 1), we can move to (2, 1).
- From (1, 2), moving to (2, 2) is possible, and from (2, 2), we can move to (3, 2) or (1, 2) back to (0, 2) which is not helpful.

## 5: Find a specific path
A potential path could be:
- (0, 2) to (1, 2)
- (1, 2) to (2, 2)
- (2, 2) to (3, 2)
- However, we need to get to (3, 1), so let's adjust:
- (0, 2) to (1, 2)
- (1, 2) to (2, 2)
- (2, 2) to (3, 2)
- (3, 2) to (4, 2) is not necessary; instead, look for a connection to (3, 1)
- Directly from (2, 2) or (3, 2) to (3, 1) is not listed, but (3, 2) to (2, 2) and then to (2, 1) and then to (3, 1) could work.

## 6: Construct the path
Let's construct a path:
- (0, 2) to (1, 2)
- (1, 2) to (2, 2)
- (2, 2) to (2, 1)
- (2, 1) to (3, 1)

## 7: Verify the path
Verify that the constructed path is valid and follows the given connections:
- (0, 2) <--> (1, 2)
- (1, 2) <--> (2, 2)
- (2, 2) <--> (3, 2) is not used, instead (2, 2) <--> (2, 1)
- (2, 1) <--> (3, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 2) (2, 1) (3, 1)}$
