OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (2, 1) and the target is at (1, 4).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (2, 1), the cell is connected to (2, 0). The target (1, 4) is connected to (1, 3) and (2, 4).

## 3: Explore paths from the origin
Starting from (2, 1), we can move to (2, 0). From (2, 0), we can move to (3, 0) or (2, 1) back to the origin, but moving to (3, 0) seems promising for exploring more paths.

## 4: Continue exploring paths
From (3, 0), we can move to (4, 0) or (2, 0). Moving to (4, 0) or back to (2, 0) doesn't seem to lead directly to the target. Let's explore other connections from (2, 1), such as moving to (2, 0) and then to (3, 0), and from there to (4, 0).

## 5: Find a path to the target
A potential path could involve moving from (2, 1) to (2, 0), then to (3, 0), and from (3, 0) to (4, 0). However, we need to find a path that leads to (1, 4). Let's consider moving from (2, 1) to (2, 2) is not directly possible, so we look for alternative routes.

## 6: Detailed path exploration
From (2, 1), we can go to (2, 0). From (2, 0), we can go to (3, 0). From (3, 0), we can go to (4, 0). From (4, 0), we can go to (4, 1). From (4, 1), we can go to (3, 1). From (3, 1), we can go to (3, 2). From (3, 2), we can go to (3, 3). From (3, 3), we can go to (2, 3). From (2, 3), we can go to (2, 4). From (2, 4), we can go to (1, 4), which is the target.

## 7: Construct the path
The path from (2, 1) to (1, 4) is: (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (1, 4)}$
