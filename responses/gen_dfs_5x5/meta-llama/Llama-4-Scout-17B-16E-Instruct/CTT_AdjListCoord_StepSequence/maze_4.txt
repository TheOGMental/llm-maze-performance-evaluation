OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (2, 3) and the target is at (0, 0).

## 2: Identify the connections from the origin
From (2, 3), the connected cells are (2, 4) and (2, 2) because (2, 3) <--> (2, 4) and (2, 2) <--> (2, 3).

## 3: Explore the path through (2, 4)
From (2, 4), the connected cells are (1, 4) and (2, 3). Since (2, 3) is the origin, we look at (1, 4). From (1, 4), the cell (0, 4) is connected. From (0, 4), the cell (0, 3) is connected. From (0, 3), the cell (0, 2) is connected. From (0, 2), there is no direct connection to (0, 0), so we need to explore other paths.

## 4: Explore the path through (2, 2)
From (2, 2), the connected cells are (1, 2) and (2, 3). Since (2, 3) is the origin, we look at (1, 2). From (1, 2), the cell (1, 1) is connected. From (1, 1), the cell (0, 1) is connected. From (0, 1), the cell (0, 0) is connected.

## 5: Construct the path from origin to target
The path from (2, 3) to (0, 0) can be constructed as follows: (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0).

## 6: Verify the path
Verify that each step in the path is valid according to the given adjacency list.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3) (2, 2) (1, 2) (1, 1) (0, 1) (0, 0)}$
