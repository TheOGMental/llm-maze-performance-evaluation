OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (1, 0) and the target is at (1, 2).

## 2: Identify the connections of the origin and target
From the origin (1, 0), we can move to (1, 1) and (0, 1) is not directly connected but (1,1) and (2,0) are connected to (1,0) or its neighbors. The target (1, 2) is connected to (1, 1) and (0, 2).

## 3: Explore paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (1, 0), we can move to (1, 1). From (1, 1), we can move to (1, 2) which is the target.

## 4: Verify if a shorter or direct path exists
There's a direct connection from (1, 1) to (1, 2), making the path from (1, 0) to (1, 1) to (1, 2) a potential shortest path.

## 5: Construct the path
The path from the origin (1, 0) to the target (1, 2) is: (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2)}$
