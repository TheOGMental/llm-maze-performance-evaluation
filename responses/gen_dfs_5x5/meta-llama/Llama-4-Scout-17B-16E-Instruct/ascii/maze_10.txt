We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the start and end points
The start point (S) is located at:
#      S# #
which translates to coordinates (2, 5) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0) and count rows and columns starting from 0.

The end point (E) is located at:
# # # #E  #
which translates to coordinates (1, 4).

## 3: Analyze the maze for a path
Looking at the maze, there are no obstacles marked (like 'X' in the previous maze), so we can move up, down, left, or right freely.

## 4: Determine the path
Starting from S at (2, 5), we can move up to (1, 5), then to (1, 4) which is E.

## 5: Specify the path
The path can be described as follows:
- Start at S: (2, 5)
- Move up to: (1, 5)
- Move left to: (1, 4) which is E.

## 6: Translate the path into maze coordinates
Given the maze structure:
- (2, 5) corresponds to the 'S' in #      S# #
- (1, 5) corresponds to a position in # # # #E  #
- (1, 4) corresponds to the 'E' in # # # #E  #

## 7: Write down the path
The path from S to E is: down is not needed, so we go up and left.
From #      S# #, go up to # # # #E  #, which means moving from row 2 to row 1, and then moving left until we reach E.

## 8: Detailed step-by-step path
1. At (2,5) which is S.
2. Move up to (1,5).
3. Move left to (1,4) which is E.

## 9: Represent the path in the maze
The path can be represented as moving up from S and then left towards E.

The final answer is: 
Up, Left, Left, Up, Left, Left, Up
