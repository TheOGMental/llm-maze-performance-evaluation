OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the Maze Configuration
The given maze is:
###########
#   # # # #
# # #######
#S#E#     #
# ####### #
# #     # #
# # ### # #
#   # #   #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at the bottom left of the maze, and the target (E) is located at the bottom right of the maze, but given the structure, S seems to be at the start of the path and E at the end. Let's correct that based on standard maze notation: S is the start, and E is the end.

## 3: Analyze the Maze Structure
The maze has several walls and open paths. The start (S) is at:
#S#E#     #
and the end (E) is at the same line.

## 4: Find a Path from S to E
Given the maze:
###########
#   # # # #
# # #######
#S#E#     #
# ####### #
# #     # #
# # ### # #
#   # #   #
###########
# # # # # #

Let's navigate from S to E step by step.

## 5: Navigate Through the Maze
Starting from S:
- Move right from S to avoid walls.

## 6: Detailed Step-by-Step Movement
1. From #S#E#     #, move right to #S E#     #.
2. Since we are at #S E#     #, and there's no direct path to E due to walls, let's move up and then navigate through the maze.
3. Move up to # ####### #, then move left or right to find an opening.
4. The path seems to require moving up first: 
- Up from #S#E#     # to # ####### #,
- Then left/right to navigate through.

## 7: Actual Path Finding
A possible path could be:
- Start at S, move up (but we need to go around walls),
- The direct path is blocked, so let's analyze:
  - From S, go up to the #   # # # # line, then navigate.

## 8: Specific Moves
Given the complexity, let's outline:
1. S is at (2,1) if we consider the bottom left as (1,1).
2. E is at (2,5).
3. Moving up from S: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) is not possible due to walls.
4. Alternative: Move right from S, (2,1) -> (2,2) is blocked by wall, so consider (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1).

## 9: Finding the Optimal Path
The optimal path considering standard movement (up, down, left, right) and avoiding walls:
- (2,1) to (2,2) is blocked.
- Go (2,1) to (3,1) [right], 
- Then up or down to navigate.

## 10: Path
A viable path:
- S at (2,1),
- Move right to (3,1),
- Up to (3,2) is blocked, so consider (3,1) to (3,0) is not an option, walls block.
- Correct approach: From S(2,1), move up (1,1), then right (1,2), down (2,2) is blocked, re-evaluate.

## 11: Re-evaluation
Re-evaluating for simplicity and accuracy:
- The maze requires a systematic approach to find S to E.

## 12: Systematic Approach
Let's draw it out or describe:
1. Start S,
2. Go up,
3. Navigate right and left.

The final answer is: 
No simple step-by-step text can replace visual path illustration, but here is a path in a textual format assuming grid positions (row, column) starting from bottom:
(1,1) S -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) E.
