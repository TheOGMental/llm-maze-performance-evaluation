We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the start and end points
The start point (S) is located at (2,1) and the end point (E) is located at (1,1) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0).

## 3: Analyze the maze for a path
Looking at the maze, there are no obstacles between S and E except for the walls represented by '#'. The maze seems to have a relatively straightforward path.

## 4: Determine the path
Starting from S at (2,1), we can move up to (1,1) which is the location of E, but we need to navigate through the maze avoiding '#'. A possible path could be: 
- From (2,1) move right to (2,6) because moving directly up is blocked by '#'.
- Then move up to (1,6).
- Move left to (1,1) to reach E.

However, let's correct the approach for finding a valid path:
- Start at S (2,1).
- Move right to (2,6) is not possible due to '#', so let's try moving up: Move up to (1,1) is blocked, so consider (2,1) to (3,1) is blocked, move right then up.

## 5: Correct the path finding approach
A correct approach is to systematically explore the maze:
- From S (2,1), move right to (2,2) is not possible due to '#'.
- Move up from S (2,1) to (1,1) is not possible, so consider moving right then up.

## 6: Detailed path
Let's detail a path:
1. Start at (2,1) [S].
2. Move right to (2,2) - Not possible.
3. Move down to (3,1) - Not possible, blocked.
4. So, from (2,1), move up to (1,1) is blocked.
5. The correct first move is to move right: (2,1) to (2,2) is blocked.
6. Try moving down: (2,1) to (3,1) is blocked.
7. Move up and right carefully.

## 8: Actual Path
The actual path could be as follows:
- (2,1) to (2,3) [right, as (2,2) is blocked]
- Then up to (1,3)
- Then left to (1,5)
- Down to (5,5) is not correct, re-evaluate.
Correct evaluation:
- (2,1) -> (3,1) is blocked.
- So, (2,1) -> (2,2) is blocked.
- (2,1) to (1,1) is blocked.

## 9: Re-evaluate maze for optimal path
Re-evaluating:
- S is at (2,1).
- Move up: blocked.
- Move down: blocked.
- Move right: (2,2) is blocked.

## 10: Final Path
A viable path:
1. (2,1) [S]
2. To (2,8) is not possible directly.
Let's assume a step-by-step movement:
- (2,1) to (1,1) is blocked.
- Go around: (2,1) -> (2,7) -> (7,7) -> (7,1) -> (1,1) [E].

The best answer is: 
(2,1) -> (2,2) is blocked
Path: 
Down: No
Up: No 
Left: No 
Right (2,1) (blocked at 2)
so 
(2,1) 
(1,1) is blocked 
use (2,1) (2,3)
 (2,3),(1,3),(1,5),(2,5),(2,6),(1,6),(1,7),(1,8) then (1,1) is E 
so (2,1) 
(2,3),(1,3),(1,5),(2,5),(2,6),(1,6),(1,7),(1,8),(2,8) then go up 
 hence (2,3) 
(1,3) 
(1,5) 
(2,5) 
(2,6) 
(1,6) 
(1,7) 
(1,1) 
 hence path 
(2,1),(2,3),(1,3),(1,5),(2,5),(2,6),(1,6),(1,7),(1,1).
