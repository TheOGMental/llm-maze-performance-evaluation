OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Analyze the given maze configuration
The maze is represented as a grid of characters, where '#' represents walls, ' ' (space) represents open paths, 'E' represents the target (exit), and 'S' represents the origin (start). The goal is to find a path from 'S' to 'E'.

## 2: Identify the start and end points
The start point 'S' is located at the bottom of the maze, and the end point 'E' is at the top. The exact coordinates are needed for precise movement.

## 3: Determine the coordinates of start and end points
Upon inspection, 'S' is at (9, 1) and 'E' is at (1, 6) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0).

## 4: Explore possible paths
Given the maze structure, we can use a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path. However, for simplicity and given the constraints, we can attempt to find a path manually by looking for open spaces and avoiding walls.

## 5: Manual pathfinding
Starting from 'S' at (9, 1), we look for a path upwards and to the left or right to 'E' at (1, 6). The maze has several openings that could lead to 'E', but we must navigate through the '#' walls.

## 6: Describe the path
A possible path could be:
- From 'S' (9, 1), move up to (8, 1) because moving directly up is blocked by a wall.
- Then, move right to (8, 2), up to (7, 2), right to (7, 3), up to (6, 3), right to (6, 4), up to (5, 4), left to (5, 3), up to (4, 3), left to (4, 2), up to (3, 2), left to (3, 1), up to (2, 1), left to (2, 2), up to (1, 2), and then right to (1, 6) where 'E' is located.

## 7: Convert path into maze coordinates and directions
The path in detailed steps:
1. (9,1) -> (8,1)
2. (8,1) -> (8,2)
3. (8,2) -> (7,2)
4. (7,2) -> (7,3)
5. (7,3) -> (6,3)
6. (6,3) -> (6,4)
7. (6,4) -> (5,4)
8. (5,4) -> (5,3)
9. (5,3) -> (4,3)
10. (4,3) -> (4,2)
11. (4,2) -> (3,2)
12. (3,2) -> (3,1)
13. (3,1) -> (2,1)
14. (2,1) -> (2,2)
15. (2,2) -> (1,2)
16. (1,2) -> (1,6)

## 8: Verify the path
This path avoids '#' and reaches 'E' from 'S'.

The final answer is: 
(S) -> (9,1)
-> (8,1)
-> (8,2)
-> (7,2)
-> (7,3)
-> (6,3)
-> (6,4)
-> (5,4)
-> (5,3)
-> (4,3)
-> (4,2)
-> (3,2)
-> (3,1)
-> (2,1)
-> (2,2)
-> (1,2)
-> (1,3)
-> (1,4)
-> (1,5)
-> (1,6) (E)
