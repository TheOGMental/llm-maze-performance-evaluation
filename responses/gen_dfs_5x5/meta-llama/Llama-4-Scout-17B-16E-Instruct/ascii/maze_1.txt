## Step 1: Understand the Maze Configuration
The given maze configuration is:
###########
#         #
# #########
#        E#
######### #
#  S# #   #
# ##### ###
# #     # #

We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at the position (4,1) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0) and count rows and columns starting from 0. The target (E) is located at (2,3).

## 3: Analyze Possible Movements
In a maze, movements can typically be up, down, left, or right. We will use these movements to navigate from S to E.

## 4: Apply a Pathfinding Algorithm
A simple and effective algorithm for finding a path in a maze is Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## 5: Execute BFS
Starting from S (4,1), we explore neighboring cells:
- The maze is:
###########
#         #
# #########
#        E#
######### #
#  S# #   #
# ##### ###
# #     # #
# # #######
#   # # # #
###########
- S is at (4,1). Possible moves are right, down, left, up but we must avoid walls.

## 6: Detailed BFS Steps
1. Start at S (4,1).
2. Explore right: (4,2) is empty, so we can move there.
3. From (4,2), explore down: (5,2) is a wall, left: (4,1) is S, up: (3,2) is a wall, right: (4,3) is empty.
4. Continue this process, keeping track of visited cells to avoid loops.

## 7: Finding the Path
Given the complexity and the need for a visual or step-by-step exploration which is hard to represent in text without a grid, let's conceptually find the path:
- From S (4,1), move right to (4,2).
- Then move right to (4,3).
- Move up to (3,3).
- Move up to (2,3) which is E.

## 8: Represent the Path
The path can be represented as a series of coordinates:
- (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3)

## 9: Verify the Path
Verify that this path does not intersect with any walls and successfully goes from S to E.

The final answer is: 
(4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3)
