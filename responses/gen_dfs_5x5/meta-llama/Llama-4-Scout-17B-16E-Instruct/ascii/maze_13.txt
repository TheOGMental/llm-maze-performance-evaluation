We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at the top middle part of the maze, and the target (E) is located below it.

## 3: Analyze Possible Moves
From the origin (S), we can move up, down, left, or right, but we must stay within the maze boundaries and avoid hitting walls (#).

## 4: Determine the Starting Point Coordinates
Let's assume the top-left corner is (0,0). The origin (S) is at (1, 1) because the first row is ########### and the second row starts with # # #S    #, making S at (1, 6) if we count from (0,0) for the first #.

## 5: Find a Path to the Target
Starting from (1,6), we look for a path to (1,3) where E is located, considering the maze layout.

## 6: Explore Paths
From (1,6), moving down is not possible due to the wall, so we move left or right. Moving left to (0,6) is possible, then down.

## 7: Detailed Path Exploration
- From (1,6), move left to (0,6).
- Then move down to (1,6) is not possible due to wall, so from (0,6), move down to (2,6) but there's a wall, adjust path: from (0,6) move down to (3,6) or explore other sides.
- Correct approach: From S (1,6), go left to (0,6), then down through (4,6) is blocked, so navigate around.

## 8: Correct Path Finding
A viable path seems to be:
- Start at S (1,6).
- Move left to (0,6).
- Move down to (0,7) is not possible, re-evaluate: move right to (2,6) then navigate.

## 9: Actual Path
Given the complexity, let's simplify:
- (1,6) to (0,6)
- (0,6) to (0,5)
- (0,5) to (0,4)
- (0,4) to (1,4) because of wall
- Continue down and around obstacles.

## 10: Precise Path
Precise step-by-step movement:
1. (1,6) -> (0,6)
2. (0,6) -> (0,5)
3. (0,5) -> (0,4)
4. (0,4) -> (1,4)
5. (1,4) -> (1,3) through available spaces.

## 11: Write Down the Path
Let's denote up as U, down as D, left as L, right as R. The path in actions:
- L (to 0,6)
- D (to 0,5)
- D (to 0,4)
- R (to 1,4)
- D (to 1,3)

The final answer is:
