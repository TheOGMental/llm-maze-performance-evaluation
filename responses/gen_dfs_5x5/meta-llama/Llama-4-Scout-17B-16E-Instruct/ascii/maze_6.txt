We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the starting and ending points
The starting point (S) is at coordinates (1,1) and the target point (E) is at coordinates (3,5) if we consider the top-left corner as (1,1).

## 3: Analyze the maze for a path
Looking at the maze, there are no obstacles between the start and end that would completely block the path. We can move up, down, left, or right.

## 4: Determine a path
Starting from S at (1,1), we can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,5), then down to (3,5) but we hit a wall, so let's adjust: from (1,1), move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,5) is not possible directly because of the wall, so we go down to (5,2) then right.

## 5: Find a detailed path
A possible path could be:
- From (1,1) move right to (1,2)
- Then down to (2,2)
- Right to (2,3)
- Down to (3,3)
- Right to (3,4)
- Down to (4,4) is blocked, so let's correct: Down to (5,2) then right to (5,5) but we need to get to E efficiently.
- Correct approach: From S (1,1), go down to (2,1), then right to (2,5) is blocked, so down to (3,1), right to (3,4), up to (2,4), right to (2,5) no, blocked. Let's simplify: go down from S.

## 6: Detailed step-by-step path
1. Start at S (1,1).
2. Move down to (2,1).
3. Move down to (3,1).
4. Move down to (4,1).
5. Move right to (4,2).
6. Move right to (4,3).
7. Move up to (3,3).
8. Move right to (3,4).
9. Move right to (3,5) which is E.

The final answer is: 
Down, Down, Down, Right, Right, Up, Right, Right
