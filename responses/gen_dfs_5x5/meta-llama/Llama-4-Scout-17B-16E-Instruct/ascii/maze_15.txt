OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the Maze Configuration
The given maze configuration is:
###########
# # # # # #
##### #####
#S   E# # #
# #########
# #   # # #
# # # #####
#   #   # #

We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at the position (2,1) and the target (E) is at (2,3) in the maze.

## 3: Analyze Possible Moves
From the origin (S), we can move up, down, left, or right, but we must avoid the walls represented by '#'.

## 4: Plan the Path
Starting from S at (2,1), we observe that moving right is the most direct way to approach E, but we need to navigate through the maze avoiding '#'.

## 5: Execute the Pathfinding
- Start at (2,1) which is S.
- Move right to (2,2) since it's not blocked.
- Then move right to (2,3) which is E.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems there might be a direct path but let's ensure:
- From (2,1), move right to (2,2).
- Then, move right to (2,3) to reach E.

But we should verify if there are any obstacles or if a more detailed step is needed for clarity.

## 6: Detailed Path
Given the maze:
###########
# # # # # #
##### #####
#S   E# # #
# #########
# #   # # #
# # # #####
#   #   # #
####### ###
#       # #
###########
A possible path could be:
1. Start at (2,1) - S.
2. Move right to (2,2).
3. Move right to (2,3) - E.

This seems straightforward, but let's confirm there's no '#' blocking the way directly.

## 7: Confirm the Path
Upon review, the direct path from S to E without hitting '#' is:
- (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)

So, the path in terms of coordinates is (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3).

## 8: Translate to Maze Coordinates and Directions
Given that (0,0) is the top-left corner of the maze, and assuming the first row is y=0 and the first column is x=0:
- S is at (1,2) because we count from 0.
- E is at (1,4).

The path in a more descriptive form:
- Move from (1,2) right to (1,3) then right to (1,4).

The final answer is: 
Right, Right
