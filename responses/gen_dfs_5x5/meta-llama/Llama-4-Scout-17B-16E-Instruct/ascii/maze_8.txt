OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the Maze Configuration
The given maze is:
###########
# # #     #
# ### #####
# # #     #
# ####### #
#E# # # # #
# ####### #
# # #   # #

We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at the bottom of the maze, and the target (E) is located near the middle.

## 3: Analyze Possible Moves
Given the maze structure, we can only move up, down, left, or right. We cannot move diagonally or through walls.

## 4: Plan the Path
Start at S and move up towards E, avoiding walls.

## 5: Determine the Path
From S, move up:
- Start at #S    #   #
- Move up to # # #   # #
- Then to # ### # # #
- Then to # ####### #
- Then to #E# # # # #

## 6: Specify the Path
The path can be specified as follows:
1. Start at (9, 8) - S
2. Move up to (8, 8)
3. Move up to (7, 8)
4. Move left to (7, 7)
5. Move left to (7, 6)
6. Move up to (6, 6)
7. Move left to (5, 6)
8. Move up to (4, 6)
9. Move left to (3, 6)
10. Move left to (2, 6)
11. Move up to (1, 6)
12. Move right to (1, 7)
13. Move right to (1, 8)
14. Move up to (0, 8) - but we need to adjust according to actual maze coordinates and ensure we end at E.

## 7: Adjust for Actual Coordinates and Ensure End at E
Correcting the approach for accurate maze coordinates:
- S is at (8, 1) if we consider the bottom left as (0,0)
- E is at (4, 5)

## 8: Detailed Step-by-Step Movement
1. (8,1) -> (7,1)
2. (7,1) -> (7,2)
3. (7,2) -> (7,3)
4. (7,3) -> (6,3)
5. (6,3) -> (5,3)
6. (5,3) -> (5,4)
7. (5,4) -> (5,5)
8. (5,5) -> (4,5) - E

The final answer is: 
S -> (8,1) 
(8,1) to (7,1) 
(7,1) to (7,2) 
(7,2) to (7,3) 
(7,3) to (6,3) 
(6,3) to (5,3) 
(5,3) to (5,4) 
(5,4) to (5,5) 
(5,5) to (4,5) = E 
So path is: 
(8,1) -> (7,1) -> (7,2) -> (7,3) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (4,5)
