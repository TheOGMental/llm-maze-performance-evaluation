## Step 1: Understand the Maze Configuration
The given maze configuration is:
###########
#S  # #  E#
# # ### # #
# #     # #
######### #
#       # #

We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at the top-left part of the maze, and the target (E) is located at the top-right part of the maze.

## 3: Analyze Possible Paths
Given the structure of the maze, we should look for the most straightforward path that avoids obstacles (#). The maze has several open areas and narrow passages.

## 4: Determine the Path
Starting from S, we move right and down, avoiding walls. A possible path could be:
- Start at S.
- Move right until we hit a wall, then move down.
- Continue down and right, navigating through the available spaces.

## 5: Detailed Path Finding
Let's detail the path:
1. From S, move down (since moving right is blocked by a wall immediately).
2. Continue down until we can move right.
3. Move right and continue navigating through the maze.

## 6: Specific Steps
Given the maze:
###########
#S  # #  E#
# # ### # #
# #     # #
######### #
#       # #
# ####### #
#     # # #

A step-by-step path:
- Start at (0,0) S.
- Move down to (1,0).
- Move down to (2,0).
- Move right to (2,1).
- Move right to (2,2).
- Move down to (3,2).
- Move right to (3,3).
- Move down to (4,3).
- Move right to (4,4).
- Move down to (5,4).
- Move right to (5,5) but we hit a wall, so adjust path:
- Move down to (6,4) then right to (6,5) is blocked, so go (6,4) to (7,4).
- Then (7,4) to (7,5).
- (7,5) to (8,5) is blocked, adjust to (7,5) to (8,4) then right.

## 7: Correcting and Finalizing the Path
Upon reevaluation for accuracy and simplicity:
- The most direct path seems to involve moving down from S, then navigating right and down through the open spaces.

## 8: Actual Path
The actual path in coordinates (assuming (0,0) is the top-left corner and (x,y) where x increases right and y increases down):
- S is at (1,0).
- Move down: (1,1), (1,2).
- Then right: (2,2), (3,2).
- Down: (4,2) but we need to navigate around the walls efficiently.

## 9: Visual Path Description
A visual and correct path:
1. (1,0) S
2. (1,1)
3. (1,2)
4. (2,2)
5. (3,2)
6. (3,3)
7. (4,3)
8. (4,4)
9. (5,4)
10. (6,4)
11. (7,4)
12. (7,5)
13. (8,5)
14. (8,6) 
15. (9,6)
16. (9,7) or directly to E if possible.

## 10: Final Path to E
Given E is at (1,6):
- The correct sequence should directly lead to E without assuming incorrect positions.

The final answer is: 
1,0 -> 1,1 -> 1,2 -> 2,2 -> 3,2 -> 3,3 -> 4,3 -> 4,4 -> 4,5 -> 5,5 -> 6,5 -> 6,6 -> 7,6 -> 8,6 -> 8,7 -> 9,7 -> 9,6 -> 1,6
