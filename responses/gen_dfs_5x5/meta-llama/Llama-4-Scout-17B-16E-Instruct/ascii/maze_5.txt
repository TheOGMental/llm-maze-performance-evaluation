We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the origin and target
The origin (S) is located at the bottom middle of the maze, and the target (E) is located in the middle left of the maze.

## 3: Analyze possible movements
In a maze, movements can be up, down, left, or right. We will use these movements to navigate from S to E.

## 4: Determine the starting point (S) coordinates
Let's assume the maze is a grid where each cell can be represented by (x, y) coordinates, with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The starting point S appears to be at (7, 7) if we consider the bottom-left corner as (0,0) for simplicity, but given the structure, let's correctly identify it: S is at (1, 7) if we count from the top-left.

## 5: Determine the target point (E) coordinates
The target E appears to be at (1, 3) if we count rows from the top.

## 6: Find a path from S to E
Given the maze:
- Start at S (1, 7)
- Move up to (1, 6)
- Move up to (1, 5)
- Move up to (1, 4)
- Move up to (1, 3) which is E

However, we must ensure the path does not go through walls (#) and only uses valid paths.

## 7: Detailed path considering maze walls
Starting from S at (1, 7):
1. Move up to (1, 6)
2. Move left to (0, 6) is not possible due to wall, so move right to (2, 6) is also not possible, stay at (1,6) and try moving up or down, but down is not possible as it leads to S. Move up.
3. At (1,6), move up to (1,5)
4. At (1,5), move left to (0,5)
5. At (0,5), move up to (0,4)
6. At (0,4), move right to (1,4)
7. At (1,4), move up to (1,3) which is E.

## 8: Verify the path
The path seems viable: From S (7,1) or correctly (1,7) to E (1,3).
- (1,7) to (1,6)
- (1,6) to (0,6) no, so (1,6) to (1,5)
- (1,5) to (0,5)
- (0,5) to (0,4)
- (0,4) to (1,4)
- (1,4) to (1,3)

Let's represent it in a simple text format for clarity:
- Down is -, Up is ^
- Right is >, Left is <

## 9: Represent the path in maze coordinates or steps
Given the nature of the problem, let's clarify:
The correct sequence based on visual inspection and step-by-step movement would actually require tracing each step carefully.

The final answer is: 
1,7 -> 1,6 -> 1,5 -> 0,5 -> 0,4 -> 1,4 -> 1,3
