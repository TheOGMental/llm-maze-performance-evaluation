OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the Maze Configuration
The given maze is:
###########
#   # # # #
# # #######
# #S# # # #
# # #######
# #E# # # #
# # #######
# # # # # #

We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin (S) is located at:
# #S# # # #
And the target (E) is located at:
# #E# # # #

## 3: Analyze Possible Paths
Given the structure of the maze, we can see that there are several walls blocking direct paths. The goal is to navigate from S to E.

## 4: Determine the Starting Point Coordinates
Let's assume the maze is a grid where each cell can be identified by (x, y) coordinates, with (0,0) being the top-left corner. The start (S) and end (E) positions need to be identified by their coordinates.

## 5: Find a Path
By inspecting the maze, we can see that:
- The start (S) is at (1, 2) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0) and count rows and columns starting from 0.
- The end (E) is at (1, 6).

## 6: Navigate Through the Maze
Starting from S at (1,2), we look for a path to E at (1,6). Given the maze layout, a possible path seems to be moving right and then up/down as necessary.

## 7: Detailed Path Finding
From (1,2), moving right is not possible due to walls, so we move down to (3,2), then right to (3,3) is not possible, so we actually move up to (1,2) and then down is not an option, we see that we can move right from (1,2) to (2,2) is not possible, we move down.

## 8: Actual Path
A viable path:
- Start at S (1,2).
- Move down to (3,2).
- Then to (4,2) is blocked, so from (3,2) move right to (3,3) is blocked.
- Re-evaluate: From S(1,2), go down to (3,2), then right to (3,7) is blocked by a wall, so navigate around.

## 9: Correct Approach
Given the complexity and my previous step-by-step, let's simplify:
- From # #S# # # #, move down.

## 10: Execute Path Finding
Upon re-evaluation, a straightforward path:
1. Start at S: (1,2)
2. Move down: (3,2)
3. Move right: Not possible directly, navigate through.

## 11: Manual Path
Manually tracing:
- S is at y=2, x=1.
- E is at y=6, x=1.

## 12: Solution Path
The path can be described as moving from S to E by navigating around obstacles.

The final answer is: 
Down to (3,2), then right to (3,4) no, 
(1,2) to (1,3) no wall, (1,3) to (1,4) no, 
so (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) no -> 
(1,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (1,6)
or more simply in maze terms:
(1,2) S
-> down (3,2)
-> right (3,3)
-> down (5,3)
-> right (5,6)
-> up (1,6) E 

So path in maze coordinates or description: 
Down, Right, Down, Right, Right, Right, Up

Path:
1. (1,2)
2. (3,2)
3. (3,3)
4. (5,3)
5. (5,4)
6. (5,5)
7. (5,6)
8. (1,6)

Describing it directly on the maze:
From # #S# 
Go down, 
Right when possible 
end at # #E#
