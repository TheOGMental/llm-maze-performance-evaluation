OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the maze configuration
The given maze is:
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # #E    #
# ### ### #
#     #S  #
###########
We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the origin and target
The origin (S) is located at the bottom of the maze, and the target (E) is located near the top.

## 3: Determine the approach
Since the maze is relatively simple and we can see both the start and end points, we can use a straightforward approach to find a path. We'll start from the origin (S) and move towards the target (E) by exploring possible paths.

## 4: Explore possible paths from S to E
Starting from S:
- The coordinates of S can be considered as (2, 1) if we number the rows from 0 at the top and columns from 0 at the left.
- The coordinates of E can be considered as (5, 4).

## 5: Find a path
Given the maze structure, a possible path could be:
- Start at S (2, 1).
- Move up to (1, 1) since moving right is blocked by ###.
- Then move up to (0, 1).
- From (0, 1), move right to (0, 4) because there are no obstacles in this path.

## 6: Describe the path in maze coordinates
The path in terms of movements (up, down, left, right) or specific coordinates can be described as follows:
- S is at (2, 1).
- Move up to (1, 1).
- Move up to (0, 1).
- Move right through (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4) to reach E at (0, 4) or (5, 4) if adjusting for actual E position.

## 7: Adjust for actual positions and describe path
Adjusting for actual positions:
- The correct path considering standard maze solving notation (or simply describing it) would be to move from S (at the bottom) up and then right to avoid walls.

## 8: Provide the path
Given the maze:
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # # # # #
###########
# # #E    #
# ### ### #
#     #S  #
###########
A path could be:
1. Start at S (bottom middle).
2. Go up.
3. Continue up.
4. Go right when possible.

## 9: Detailed step-by-step path
Starting from the bottom:
- S is at (7,5) if counting from top to bottom and left to right starting at 0.
- Move up to (6,5).
- Move up to (5,5).
- Move up to (4,5).
- Move up to (3,5).
- Move up to (2,5).
- Move up to (1,5).
- Move up to (0,5).
- Then move right to (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9) but we need to stop at E.

## 10: Final path description
The final path description:
From S at (7, 5):
- Up to (6, 5).
- Up to (5, 5).
- Up to (4, 5).
- Up to (3, 5).
- Up to (2, 5).
- Up to (1, 5).
- Up to (0, 5).
- Right to (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), then stop at E (which seems to be around (5,4) or adjust according to actual grid).

The final answer is: 
Up, Up, Up, Up, Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right
