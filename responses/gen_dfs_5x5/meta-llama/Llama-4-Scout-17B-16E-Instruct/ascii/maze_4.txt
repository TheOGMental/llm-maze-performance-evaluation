We need to find a path from the origin (E) to the target (S).

## 2: Identify the Origin and Target
The origin is marked as 'E' and the target as 'S'. Their positions are:
- Origin (E): (1,1)
- Target (S): (5,5)

## 3: Analyze the Maze
Looking at the maze, there are walls represented by '#' and open paths represented by spaces. We can move up, down, left, or right.

## 4: Plan the Path
Starting from 'E' at (1,1), we look for a path to 'S' at (5,5). The maze has several obstacles, so we need to navigate around them.

## 5: Execute the Pathfinding
From 'E' (1,1), we can move right to (1,2) since moving down is blocked by a wall.

## 6: Continue Pathfinding
Moving right from (1,2) to (1,3) is possible, then down to (2,3) is not possible due to the wall, so we move down from (1,3) to (2,3) is actually not an option, we go down from (1,2) to (2,2) and then navigate through.

## 7: Detailed Path
A detailed step-by-step path:
1. From (1,1) move right to (1,2).
2. Then move right to (1,3).
3. Move down to (2,3) is blocked, so from (1,3) move down to (2,3) is not possible, adjust path: move down from (1,2) to (2,2).
4. From (2,2), move right to (2,3) is blocked, so move down to (3,2).
5. From (3,2), move right to (3,3).
6. Then move right to (3,4).
7. Move down to (4,4).
8. Move right to (4,5).
9. Move down to (5,5) where 'S' is.

## 8: Correct the Path with Actual Moves
Correcting and detailing the path with actual moves:
- Start at (1,1) 'E'.
- Move right: (1,1) -> (1,2).
- Move right: (1,2) -> (1,3).
- Move down: (1,3) -> (2,3) is blocked, so (1,2) -> (2,2).
- From (2,2), move down: (2,2) -> (3,2).
- Move right: (3,2) -> (3,3).
- Move right: (3,3) -> (3,4).
- Move down: (3,4) -> (4,4).
- Move right: (4,4) -> (4,5).
- Move down: (4,5) -> (5,5) 'S'.

The final answer is: 
(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) is incorrect due to wall, 
so (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) 
is (1,1) E to (2,1) then (3,1) then (3,2) then (3,3) then (3,4) then (4,4) then (4,5) then (5,5) S 
or more simply in maze terms: 
Down, Right, Down, Down, Right, Right, Down, Right.
