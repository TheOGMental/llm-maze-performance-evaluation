We need to find a path from the origin (S) to the target (E).

## 2: Identify the origin and target positions
The origin (S) is located at position (1,1) and the target (E) is located at position (1,7).

## 3: Analyze the maze for a path
Looking at the maze, there are no obstacles (represented by '#') blocking the direct path between S and E, but we have to navigate through the maze avoiding '#'.

## 4: Determine the path
Starting from S at (1,1), we can move right to (1,2), then to (1,3), but we see '#' at (1,3) and below it. So, we move down to (2,1) then right to (2,2) is blocked by '#', so we actually move down to (3,1) and then right.

## 5: Detailed pathfinding
A possible path could be:
- Start at S (1,1)
- Move right to (1,2)
- Move down to (2,2) is blocked, so move down to (3,1) then right to (3,2)
- Continue right to (3,3) then down to (4,3) then right to (4,4)
- Move down to (5,4) then right to (5,5)
- Move down to (6,5) then right to (6,6)
- Move down to (7,6) then right to (7,7) then up to (6,7) is not possible due to '#', re-evaluate path.
- Re-evaluate: Move down from (1,1) to (2,1) is blocked by '#', so from (1,1) move right to (1,2) then down.

## 6: Correct detailed pathfinding
Correcting the approach:
- From (1,1) move right to (1,2) [S]
- Then right to (1,3)
- Down to (2,3) then right to (2,4)
- Down to (3,4) then right to (3,5)
- Down to (4,5) then right to (4,6)
- Down to (5,6) then right to (5,7) [E]

## 7: Verify the path
Verifying the path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (5,6) -> (5,7)

The final answer is: 
(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (5,7)
