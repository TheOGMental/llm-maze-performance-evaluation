OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (1,0) and the target is at (0,2).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (1,0), the cell is connected to (0,0) and (1,1). The target is at (0,2), which is connected to (0,1) and (0,3).

## 3: Explore paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (1,0), we can move to (0,0) or (1,1). We need to find a path that leads to (0,2).

## 4: Analyze the path through (0,0)
From (0,0), we can move to (0,1). Since (0,1) is connected to (0,2), this seems like a promising path.

## 5: Construct the path
The path from (1,0) to (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) appears to be a valid path to the target.

## 6: Verify the path
- (1,0) is connected to (0,0)
- (0,0) is connected to (0,1)
- (0,1) is connected to (0,2)

This verifies that the path is correct.

## 7: Provide the path
The path from the origin (1,0) to the target (0,2) is: (1,0) (0,0) (0,1) (0,2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1,0) (0,0) (0,1) (0,2)}$
