<ADJLIST_START> (2,3) <--> (3,3) ; (3,1) <--> (4,1) ; (2,2) <--> (3,2) ; (0,4) <--> (0,3) ; (3,0) <--> (2,0) ; (1,4) <--> (2,4) ; (4,3) <--> (3,3) ; (4,1) <--> (4,0) ; (2,1) <--> (1,1) ; (1,3) <--> (1,2) ; (4,3) <--> (4,2) ; (2,1) <--> (2,0) ; (2,4) <--> (2,3) ; (0,3) <--> (1,3) ; (1,1) <--> (0,1) ; (2,2) <--> (1,2) ; (3,1) <--> (3,2) ; (4,0) <--> (3,0) ; (0,4) <--> (1,4) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,1) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (0,4) <TARGET_END>

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (0,1) and the target is at (0,4).

## 2: Identify the origin and target
The origin is (0,1) and the target is (0,4). We need to find a path from (0,1) to (0,4).

## 3: Analyze the connections from the origin
From (0,1), we can move to (1,1) as per the given adjacency list: (1,1) <--> (0,1).

## 4: Explore paths from (1,1)
From (1,1), we can move to (2,1) as per: (2,1) <--> (1,1).

## 5: Continue exploring paths from (2,1)
From (2,1), we can move to (2,0) or (1,1) and then to other cells. However, moving to (2,0) seems promising because it connects to (3,0) and (2,2) is also an option through (2,1) <--> (2,0) is not directly connected but (2,1) <--> (1,1) and then no direct connection to (0,4), so let's explore (2,1) to (1,1) and then (0,1) to see if we missed any direct connections to the target or its vicinity.

## 6: Explore alternative paths directly towards the target
Directly from (0,1), we can also consider moving to cells that could lead us closer to (0,4). Notably, (0,1) <--> (1,1) and then from (1,1) to (1,2) or (1,3) or (1,4) could be beneficial.

## 7: Analyze connection to (1,4) and then to (0,4)
From (1,1), there's no direct connection to (1,4), but we see (1,3) <--> (1,2) and (1,4) <--> (2,4). Also, (0,4) <--> (1,4) and (0,4) <--> (0,3). Let's explore (0,1) to (1,1) to (2,1) and see if we can get to (0,4) through other connections.

## 8: Detailed exploration from (2,1)
From (2,1), we can go to (2,0) and then to (3,0) or (2,2). From (2,2), we can go to (3,2) or (1,2). Let's explore the path through (2,0) to (3,0) and then to (4,0) and see if it connects us to the target.

## 9: Explore path through (2,0) to (3,0)
From (3,0), we can move to (4,0) or (2,0). From (4,0), we can move to (4,1) or (3,0). Let's see if we can reach the target from here.

## 10: Find connection to target (0,4)
Noticing (0,4) <--> (0,3) and (0,4) <--> (1,4), and (1,4) <--> (2,4), let's try to get to (1,4) or directly to (0,3) then (0,4).

## 11: Path from origin to target
A potential path could be: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,4).

## 12: Verify the path
Let's verify this path:
- (0,1) <--> (1,1)
- (1,1) <--> (2,1)
- (2,1) <--> (2,2)
- (2,2) <--> (3,2) but (2,2) <--> (1,2)
- (1,2) <--> (1,3)
- (1,3) <--> (0,3)
- (0,3) <--> (0,4)

This path seems valid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2) (1,2) (1,3) (0,3) (0,4)}$
