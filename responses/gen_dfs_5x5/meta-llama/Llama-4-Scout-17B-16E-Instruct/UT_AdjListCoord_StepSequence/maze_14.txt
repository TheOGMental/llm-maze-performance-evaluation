OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (3,3) and the target is at (3,0).

## 2: Identify the connections of the origin and target
From the origin (3,3), we can move to (3,2) or (3,4). The target (3,0) is connected to (3,1) and (4,0).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (3,3), we can go to (3,2). From (3,2), we don't have a direct connection to the target or its immediate neighbors, so we need to explore other paths.

## 4: Find a path from (3,3) to (3,0)
One possible path could be: (3,3) -> (3,2) -> We need to find a way to get to (3,1) or (4,1) or (4,0) and then to (3,0). Noticing the connections, if we go from (3,3) to (3,4) to (4,4), we can then move to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1) to (3,1) and finally to (3,0).

## 5: Construct the path
Let's construct a path: (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0).

## 6: Verify the path
Verify that the constructed path is valid and reaches from the origin (3,3) to the target (3,0) using the given connections.

The final answer is: 
(3,3) (3,4) (4,4) (4,3) (4,2) (4,1) (3,1) (3,0)
