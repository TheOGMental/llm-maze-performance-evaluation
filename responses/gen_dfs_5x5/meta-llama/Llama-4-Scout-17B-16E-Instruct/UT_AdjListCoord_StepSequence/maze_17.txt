EXPECTED SOLUTION:

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (4,4) and the target is at (4,2).

## 2: Identify the origin and target points
The origin point is (4,4) and the target point is (4,2).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin to the target
To find a path, we can start from the origin (4,4) and explore neighboring cells until we reach the target (4,2).

## 4: Apply a pathfinding algorithm or manual search
Given the adjacency list, we can manually trace a path or apply a simple algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

## 5: Analyze connections from the origin (4,4)
From (4,4), we can move to (3,4) or (4,3).

## 6: Continue exploring from (3,4)
From (3,4), we can move to (2,4) or (4,4). Moving back to (4,4) is not helpful, so we try (2,4).

## 7: Explore from (2,4)
From (2,4), we can move to (2,3).

## 8: Explore from (2,3)
From (2,3), we can move to (2,2) or (2,4). Moving back to (2,4) is not helpful.

## 9: Explore from (2,2)
From (2,2), we can move to (1,2) or (2,3). Moving back to (2,3) is not helpful.

## 10: Explore from (1,2)
From (1,2), we can move to (1,3) or (2,2). Moving back to (2,2) is not helpful.

## 11: Explore from (1,3)
From (1,3), we can move to (1,4) or (2,3). Moving to (1,4) or back to (2,3) does not help.

## 12: Look for a more direct path to the target (4,2)
Let's reconsider our approach and look for a more direct path. From (4,4), we can go to (4,3) or (3,4). From (4,3), we can go to (3,3) or (4,2) directly.

## 13: Direct path to target
Directly moving from (4,4) to (4,3) and then to (4,2) seems promising.

## 14: Confirm the path
The path from (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) is a valid path according to the given adjacency list.

## 15: Write down the path
The path is: (4,4) (4,3) (4,2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4,4) (4,3) (4,2)}$
