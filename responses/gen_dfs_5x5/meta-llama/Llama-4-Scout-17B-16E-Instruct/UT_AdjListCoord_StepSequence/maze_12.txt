OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (4,3) and the target is at (3,2).

## 2: Identify the connections of the origin and target
From the origin (4,3), the cell is connected to (4,4). The target (3,2) is connected to (3,3) and (4,2).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (4,3), we can move to (4,4). From (4,4), we can move to (3,4). From (3,4), we can move to (3,3). From (3,3), we can move to (3,2), which is the target.

## 4: Construct the path
The path from the origin (4,3) to the target (3,2) can be constructed as follows: (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).

## 5: Verify if the constructed path is valid and optimal
The constructed path (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is a valid path as it follows the connections given in the maze. To ensure it's optimal, we should check if there are shorter paths. An alternative path could be: (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2). This path is shorter.

## 6: Compare and select the optimal path
Comparing the paths:
1. (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) has 4 steps.
2. (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) has 2 steps.

The second path is shorter and thus optimal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4,3) (4,2) (3,2)}$
