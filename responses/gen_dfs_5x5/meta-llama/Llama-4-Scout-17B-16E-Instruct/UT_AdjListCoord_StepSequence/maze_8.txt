OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (4,0) and the target is at (2,0).

## 2: Identify the origin and target
The origin is (4,0) and the target is (2,0). We need to find a path from (4,0) to (2,0).

## 3: Analyze the connections
From the given adjacency list:
- (4,2) is connected to (3,2) and (4,1).
- (4,2) is not directly connected to (4,0) or (2,0).
- (4,0) is connected to (4,1) and (3,0).
- (3,0) is connected to (2,0) and (4,0).

## 4: Find a path from origin to target
Given that (4,0) is connected to (3,0) and (3,0) is connected to (2,0), a direct path can be found.

## 5: Construct the path
The path from (4,0) to (2,0) is: (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0).

## 6: Verify the path with the given format
The path (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) can be represented as (4,0) (3,0) (2,0).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4,0) (3,0) (2,0)}$
