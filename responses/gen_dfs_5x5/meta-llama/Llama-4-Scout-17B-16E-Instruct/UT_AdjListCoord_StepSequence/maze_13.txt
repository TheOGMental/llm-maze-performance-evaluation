<ADJLIST_START> (0,3) <--> (0,2) ; (2,2) <--> (1,2) ; (3,3) <--> (3,2) ; (3,4) <--> (2,4) ; (4,3) <--> (4,4) ; (2,4) <--> (1,4) ; (0,4) <--> (1,4) ; (0,4) <--> (0,3) ; (4,3) <--> (4,2) ; (3,4) <--> (3,3) ; (1,2) <--> (0,2) ; (3,2) <--> (4,2) ; <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,2) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,2) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (0,2) (1,2) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (0,2) and the target is at (1,2).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (0,2), we can see it's connected to (0,3) and (1,2) directly.

## 3: Determine the direct path to the target if possible
Since (0,2) is directly connected to (1,2), which is the target, we have a straightforward path.

## 4: Verify the path
The path from (0,2) to (1,2) is a direct connection as per the given adjacency list: (0,2) <--> (1,2).

## 5: Provide the path
Given that there's a direct connection, the path from the origin (0,2) to the target (1,2) is simply (0,2) (1,2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0,2) (1,2)}$
