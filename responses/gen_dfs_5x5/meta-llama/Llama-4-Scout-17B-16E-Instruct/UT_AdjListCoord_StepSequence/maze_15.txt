OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (1,0) and the target is at (1,2).

## 2: Identify the connections relevant to the origin and target
From the origin (1,0), the connected cells are (1,1) and (2,0). The target is at (1,2), and it is connected to (0,2) and (1,1).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin to the target
Starting from (1,0), we can move to (1,1) or (2,0). Let's explore both options to find a path to (1,2).

## 4: Explore the path through (1,1)
If we move from (1,0) to (1,1), we are one step away from the target since (1,1) is connected to (1,2).

## 5: Construct the path
The direct path from (1,0) to (1,2) can be constructed as follows: (1,0) to (1,1) to (1,2).

## 6: Verify the path with the given adjacency list
According to the adjacency list, (1,0) <--> (1,1) and (1,2) <--> (1,1) and (0,2). This confirms that the path (1,0) to (1,1) to (1,2) is valid.

## 7: Provide the path in the required format
The path from the origin (1,0) to the target (1,2) is: (1,0) (1,1) (1,2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)}$
