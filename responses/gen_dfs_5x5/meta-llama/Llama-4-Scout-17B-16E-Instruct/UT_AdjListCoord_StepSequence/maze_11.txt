OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin is at (0,2) and the target is at (3,1).

## 2: Identify the origin and target points
The origin point is (0,2) and the target point is (3,1).

## 3: Explore possible paths from the origin
From (0,2), we can move to (0,1) or (1,2) as per the given adjacency list.

## 4: Analyze the path through (0,1)
Moving to (0,1) from (0,2), we can then move to (0,0) or stay at (0,1) and try to find a path to the target. However, moving to (0,0) allows us to then move to (1,0).

## 5: Continue exploring paths
From (1,0), we can move to (1,1). From (1,1), we can move to (1,2) or (2,1). Moving to (1,2) leads us back to (0,2) and (2,2), and from (2,2) we can move to (3,2) or (2,1).

## 6: Find a path to the target (3,1)
From (2,1), we can move to (2,0) or (1,1). From (2,0), we move to (3,0) is not directly possible, but we can move to (2,1) and then look for other paths. Notably, from (2,2), we can move to (3,2), and then we need to find a way to (3,1).

## 7: Direct path to target
A more efficient approach is to systematically explore:
- From (0,2), move to (1,2).
- From (1,2), move to (2,2).
- From (2,2), move to (3,2).
- From (3,2), move to (4,2) is possible but not helpful for reaching (3,1).
- Instead, notice that from (3,2), we cannot directly move to (3,1), but we can move to (4,2) and then to (4,1) and then to (3,1).

## 8: Construct the path
The path can be constructed as follows:
- (0,2) to (1,2)
- (1,2) to (2,2)
- (2,2) to (3,2)
- (3,2) to (4,2)
- (4,2) to (4,1)
- (4,1) to (3,1)

## 9: Verify the path
Verify that the constructed path is valid according to the adjacency list and that it leads from the origin (0,2) to the target (3,1).

The final answer is: 
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (4,1) (3,1)
