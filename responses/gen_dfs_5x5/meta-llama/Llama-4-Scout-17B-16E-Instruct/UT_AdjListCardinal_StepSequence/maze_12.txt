OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is given in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells. The origin is at (4,3) and the target is at (3,2).

## 2: Identify the connections of the origin and target
From the given adjacency list:
- (4,0) is connected to NORTH (4,2), NORTH (4,4), and NORTH (3,3).
- (4,2) is connected to WEST (4,3) and EAST (4,1) and NORTH (4,4).
- (4,3) is connected to WEST (4,2) and EAST (4,4).
- (4,4) is connected to WEST (4,3) and NORTH (3,3).
- (3,3) is connected to WEST and EAST, but specific connections to other cells are not directly listed; however, it's connected to (4,0) NORTH, implying (3,3) is south of (4,0) but directly connected to (4,4) NORTH.

## 3: Determine the relevant connections for the origin (4,3) and target (3,2)
The origin (4,3) is connected to:
- WEST (4,2)
- EAST (4,4)

The target (3,2) is not directly listed, but we can infer connections based on given data:
- (3,3) is connected to (4,0) and presumably has connections to the south and west, given typical maze structures.

## 4: Find a path from the origin (4,3) to the target (3,2)
Given the target (3,2) and origin (4,3), let's find a path:
1. From (4,3), go WEST to (4,2).
2. From (4,2), there's no direct SOUTH or WEST to (3,2), but we can go NORTH or EAST. Since we need to get to (3,2), let's consider moving in a way that gets us closer.
3. Noticing (3,3) is connected to (4,0) and presumably to cells below it, let's try to get to (3,3) first.
4. From (4,3), go EAST to (4,4).
5. From (4,4), go NORTH to (3,3).
6. From (3,3), go SOUTH to (3,2).

## 5: Construct the path
The path from (4,3) to (3,2) is:
- (4,3) EAST (4,4)
- (4,4) NORTH (3,3)
- (3,3) SOUTH (3,2)

The final answer is: 
(4,3) EAST (4,4) NORTH (3,3) SOUTH (3,2)
