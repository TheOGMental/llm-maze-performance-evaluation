OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the maze configuration
The given maze configuration is represented as an adjacency list, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (4,4) and the target is at (4,2).

## 2: Identify the goal
The goal is to find a path from the origin (4,4) to the target (4,2) using the given connections.

## 3: Analyze the connections
From the adjacency list, we can see the following relevant connections:
- (1,4) <--> WEST (1,3) and other connections not relevant to our start or end points.
- Specifically for our area of interest:
- (3,4) <--> SOUTH (3,3) and (3,3) <--> NORTH (3,4) and (3,3) <--> EAST (4,3) and (4,3) <--> WEST (3,3).
- (4,2) <--> NORTH (3,2) is not directly listed but (4,2) <--> SOUTH is not an option, however, (4,2) is connected to (3,3) through (4,3) and (3,3) or directly if a connection exists.

## 4: Detailed examination of relevant connections
Upon a detailed examination, we notice:
- (2,4) <--> NORTH (3,4) and (3,4) <--> SOUTH (2,4).
- (3,1) <--> NORTH (2,1) and (2,2) <--> SOUTH (3,1) but no direct connection to (4,4) or (4,2).
- Direct connections to (4,4) are not listed, but we start from (4,4).

## 5: Finding a path from (4,4) to (4,2)
Given that we are at (4,4) and need to get to (4,2), let's look for a path:
- Since there's no direct connection listed from (4,4) to any other point, we assume it connects to (4,3) and (4,1) through EAST and WEST respectively, but only (4,3) is relevant as it connects to (3,3) and then potentially to (4,2).

## 6: Constructing the path
From (4,4), we can move:
- WEST to (3,4) is not directly listed, but moving WEST (if it existed) or finding an alternative route.
- Given (4,3) <--> EAST (4,4) and (4,3) <--> WEST (3,3), and (3,3) <--> NORTH (3,4), let's assume a viable path could involve moving down or laterally.

## 7: Actual path identification
A potential path could be:
- (4,4) to (4,3) [Implicit, as direct connections to (4,4) aren't fully detailed but we infer from given points],
- Then (4,3) to (3,3),
- And (3,3) to (4,2) or find a suitable connection.

## 8: Direct path to target
Given the target (4,2) and origin (4,4), a straightforward path if connections allow:
- (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2).

## 9: Validate the path with given connections
The connection (4,3) to (4,2) is not directly stated but assuming a grid and typical movements (up, down, left, right), and given that (4,2) <--> connections are not fully detailed for a direct move from (4,3), let's assume a simple vertical move is possible.

## 10: Conclusion of path
Given the information and typical maze solving:
- A direct path from (4,4) to (4,2) could be (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2)}$
