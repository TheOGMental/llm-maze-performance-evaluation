OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the maze configuration
The given maze configuration is represented as an adjacency list, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (0,0) and the target is at (0,4).

## 2: Identify the possible moves from the origin
From (0,0), the possible moves are SOUTH to (0,1).

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
We need to navigate from (0,0) to (0,4). The direct path is to move SOUTH from (0,0) to (0,1), then continue SOUTH to (0,3), and finally move SOUTH to (0,4).

## 4: Construct the path
The path can be constructed by moving SOUTH from (0,0) to (0,1), then to (0,3), and finally to (0,4). So, the path is: (0,0) SOUTH (0,1) SOUTH (0,2) is not directly available, we go (0,1) SOUTH (0,3) and then (0,3) SOUTH (0,4).

## 5: Correct the path based on available moves
Given the adjacency list, from (0,0), we can move SOUTH to (0,1), then to (0,3) directly, and then to (0,4). The correct sequence of moves is: (0,0) SOUTH (0,1) is not directly connected to (0,3) or (0,4) without intermediate steps, we see (0,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> SOUTH (0,3) <--> SOUTH (0,4). So, the path is (0,0) SOUTH (0,1) SOUTH (0,3) SOUTH (0,4).

## 6: Verify the path
Verify that the path (0,0) SOUTH (0,1) SOUTH (0,3) SOUTH (0,4) is valid and reaches the target (0,4) from the origin (0,0).

The final answer is: 
(0,0) SOUTH (0,1) SOUTH (0,3) SOUTH (0,4)
