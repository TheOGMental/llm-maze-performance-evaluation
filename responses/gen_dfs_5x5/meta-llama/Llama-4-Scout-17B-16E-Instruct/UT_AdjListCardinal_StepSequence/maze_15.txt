OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (1,0) and the target is at (1,2).

## 2: Identify the possible moves from the origin
From the origin (1,0), the possible moves are SOUTH (3,0) and NORTH (1,0) is not a move since it leads back to itself, but EAST (1,1) is a valid move.

## 3: Determine the path to the target
Given the origin (1,0) and the target (1,2), we should look for a direct or indirect path. Noticing that (1,0) has a direct connection to (1,2) through NORTH, we can consider this as a potential path.

## 4: Explore the direct path
The direct path from (1,0) to (1,2) involves moving NORTH. According to the adjacency list, (1,0) is connected to (1,2) through NORTH.

## 5: Verify the path
The path can be verified as follows: Start at (1,0), move NORTH to (1,2). This path is straightforward and does not require additional steps.

## 6: Represent the path in the required format
The path from (1,0) to (1,2) is: (1,0) NORTH (1,2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1,0) NORTH (1,2)}$
