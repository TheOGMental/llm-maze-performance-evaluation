<ADJLIST_START> (0,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> SOUTH (1,0) <--> SOUTH (2,4) <--> NORTH (3,0) <--> NORTH (2,1) <--> SOUTH (3,3) <--> NORTH (2,4) <--> SOUTH (0,1) <--> WEST (1,2) <--> EAST (1,4) <--> WEST (2,2) <--> WEST (2,2) <--> EAST (3,1) <--> WEST (3,4) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (1,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,1) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (1,0) NORTH (0,0) EAST (0,1) SOUTH (1,1) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (1,0) and the target is at (1,1).

## 2: Identify the relevant connections for the origin and target
From the origin (1,0), the possible moves are SOUTH (1,1) and EAST (1,2) is not directly listed but we see (1,0) <--> SOUTH (2,4) and (1,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) and (1,0) <--> NORTH is not listed but (0,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) and (0,0) is not directly connected to (1,0) but (1,0) <--> SOUTH. The target is at (1,1).

## 3: Determine the direct path if possible
Given that (1,0) has a direct connection to (1,1) as (1,0) <--> SOUTH (0,1) and also (1,0) <--> SOUTH (2,4) but most directly (1,0) is connected to (1,1) through a SOUTH move based on standard maze movement (up, down, left, right).

## 4: Construct the path
The path from (1,0) to (1,1) is straightforward since (1,0) is directly connected to (1,1) via a SOUTH move.

## 5: Verify the path with the given format
The path in the required format is: <PATH_START> (1,0) SOUTH (1,1) <PATH_END>.

The final answer is: 
<PATH_START> (1,0) SOUTH (1,1) <PATH_END>
