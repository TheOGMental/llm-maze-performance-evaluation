EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (1,0) NORTH (0,0) EAST (0,1) EAST (0,2) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (1,0) and the target is at (0,2).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (1,0), the possible movements are NORTH to (1,4) and NORTH to (1,1).

## 3: Explore the path through (1,1)
Moving NORTH from (1,0) to (1,1). From (1,1), we can move SOUTH to (2,2), WEST to (0,1), or EAST is not directly available as per the given adjlist.

## 4: Explore the path through (0,1) from (1,1)
From (1,1), moving WEST to (0,1). From (0,1), we can move NORTH is not available, but we can move EAST to (0,2) which is our target.

## 5: Construct the path from origin to target
The path can be constructed as follows: Start at (1,0), move NORTH to (1,1), then move WEST to (0,1), and finally move EAST to (0,2).

## 6: Verify the path
Verify that the constructed path does not violate any maze rules and that it indeed leads from the origin (1,0) to the target (0,2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1,0) NORTH (1,1) WEST (0,1) EAST (0,2)}$
