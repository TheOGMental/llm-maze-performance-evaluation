EXPECTED SOLUTION:

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (1,3) and the target is at (0,3).

## 2: Identify the relevant connections for the origin and target
From the origin (1,3), the cell is connected to (0,3) to the west and to (1,4) to the south and (1,1) to the west (with a duplicate connection to (1,1) which can be ignored for simplicity). The target is at (0,3), which is directly connected to (1,3).

## 3: Determine the path from the origin to the target
Given that (1,3) is directly connected to (0,3) by moving west, we can establish a straightforward path.

## 4: Construct the path
The path from (1,3) to (0,3) is simply moving west: (1,3) WEST (0,3).

## 5: Verify if the path is valid and complete
The path (1,3) WEST (0,3) starts at the origin (1,3) and ends at the target (0,3), making it a valid and complete path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1,3) WEST (0,3)}$
