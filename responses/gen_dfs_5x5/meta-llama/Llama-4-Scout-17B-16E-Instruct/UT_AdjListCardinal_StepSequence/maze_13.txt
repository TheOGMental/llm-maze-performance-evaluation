INPUT:
<ADJLIST_START> (1,2) <--> NORTH (0,4) <--> SOUTH (1,2) <--> SOUTH (1,4) <--> SOUTH (2,4) <--> SOUTH (4,2) <--> NORTH (0,2) <--> EAST (0,3) <--> EAST (3,2) <--> EAST (3,3) <--> EAST (4,2) <--> EAST (4,4) <--> WEST <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (0,2) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (1,2) <TARGET_END> 

EXPECTED SOLUTION:
<PATH_START> (0,2) SOUTH (1,2) <PATH_END>

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is given in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (0,2) and the target is at (1,2).

## 2: Identify the possible moves from the origin
From the origin (0,2), the possible moves are NORTH to (0,4) and EAST to (0,3).

## 3: Determine the goal
The goal is to find a path from the origin (0,2) to the target (1,2).

## 4: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
Starting from (0,2), we can move SOUTH to (1,2) directly, which is the target.

## 5: Verify if the path is valid and shortest
The path (0,2) to (1,2) is a direct move and seems to be the shortest path possible.

## 6: Format the path according to the given format
The path in the required format is: <PATH_START> (0,2) SOUTH (1,2) <PATH_END>.

The final answer is: 
<PATH_START> (0,2) SOUTH (1,2) <PATH_END>
