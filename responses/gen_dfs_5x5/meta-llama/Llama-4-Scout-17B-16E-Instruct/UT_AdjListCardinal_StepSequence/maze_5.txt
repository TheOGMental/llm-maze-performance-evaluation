EXPECTED SOLUTION:

OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (3,1) and the target is at (1,4).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (3,1), the possible movements are: NORTH (2,1), SOUTH (4,1), EAST (3,2), and WEST (3,0).

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
We need to navigate from (3,1) to (1,4). Let's start by moving NORTH to (2,1), then see where we can go from there.

## 4: Analyze the connections from (2,1)
From (2,1), we can move: NORTH (1,1), SOUTH (3,1), EAST (2,2), and WEST (2,0). Moving NORTH to (1,1) seems promising as it gets us closer to the target row.

## 5: Explore the path from (1,1)
From (1,1), we can move: NORTH (0,1), SOUTH (1,3), and EAST (1,0). However, we need to get to (1,4), so let's see if there's a connection that can take us directly or indirectly to the target.

## 6: Analyze connections to get closer to (1,4)
There's no direct connection from (1,1) to (1,4). Let's move SOUTH to (1,3) and see if we can get closer to the target from there.

## 7: Explore the path from (1,3)
From (1,3), we can move: NORTH (0,3), SOUTH (2,3), and EAST (1,2). Still, no direct path to (1,4), but moving EAST doesn't help. Let's try moving SOUTH to (2,3).

## 8: Analyze connections from (2,3)
From (2,3), we can move: NORTH (1,3), SOUTH (3,3), and EAST (2,2), WEST (2,4). Moving WEST to (2,4) or SOUTH to (3,3) might be useful.

## 9: Explore the path from (2,4)
From (2,4), we can move: NORTH (1,4), which is our target.

## 10: Construct the path from origin to target
The path can be constructed as follows: (3,1) NORTH (2,1) NORTH (1,1) SOUTH (1,3) SOUTH (2,3) SOUTH (2,4) NORTH (1,4).

The final answer is: 
(3,1) NORTH (2,1) NORTH (1,1) SOUTH (1,3) SOUTH (2,3) SOUTH (2,4) NORTH (1,4)
