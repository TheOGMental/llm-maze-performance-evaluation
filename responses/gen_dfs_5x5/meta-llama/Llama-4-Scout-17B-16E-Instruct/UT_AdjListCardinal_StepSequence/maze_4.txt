OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is given in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (2,3) and the target is at (0,0).

## 2: Identify the connections for each cell
From the given adjacency list:
- (1,1) is connected to: NORTH (0,4), SOUTH (1,2), SOUTH (1,4), SOUTH (0,1), WEST (0,2), EAST (0,3), EAST (1,2)
- (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (2,3) have specific connections but not all are listed; we focus on (2,3) and its connections.

## 3: Determine the connections for the origin (2,3)
The origin (2,3) is connected to: WEST (2,2), WEST (2,2), EAST (1,3) is not directly listed but we see (2,3) is connected to WEST (2,2) and implicitly to EAST (1,3) through the problem's context.

## 4: Correctly interpret the maze connections
Given the format, it seems there was an error in transcription. Let's assume (2,3) connects to (2,2) and (1,3) based on standard maze representations.

## 5: Find a path from the origin (2,3) to the target (0,0)
To find a path, we start at (2,3) and move towards the target (0,0). Given the connections:
- From (2,3), we can go WEST to (1,3) or WEST (2,2).
- Let's explore moving WEST to (2,2) first.

## 6: Explore the path through (2,2)
From (2,2), possible moves are not directly listed, but assuming standard movements:
- We could go WEST to (1,2) or SOUTH to (2,1) or EAST to (2,3) back.

## 7: Continue exploring paths
Since direct connections to (0,0) are not provided, let's assume (0,0) or nearby cells have connections based on a grid layout.

## 8: Analyze connections to reach (0,0)
Given (1,1) connects to (0,1) and assuming a grid, (0,0) might connect to (0,1) or (1,0).

## 9: Determine a viable path
A potential path could be: (2,3) -> WEST (2,2) -> WEST (1,2) -> NORTH (1,1) -> WEST (0,1) -> NORTH (0,0).

## 10: Validate the path
Let's validate: Starting from (2,3) to (2,2) [WEST], then to (1,2) [WEST], then to (1,1) [SOUTH or NORTH, but we choose NORTH for proximity], then to (0,1) [WEST], and finally to (0,0) [NORTH].

## 11: Confirm the path with given connections
The path (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) seems plausible. Let's ensure it matches given connections:
- (2,3) to (2,2) is WEST.
- (2,2) to (1,2) is WEST.
- (1,2) to (1,1) is NORTH.
- (1,1) to (0,1) is SOUTH or WEST, but we need (0,1) to (0,0) which would be NORTH.

## 12: Adjust for accurate connections
Given (1,1) connects to (0,1), the path can be: (2,3) -> WEST (2,2) -> WEST (1,2) -> NORTH (1,1) -> SOUTH (0,1) -> NORTH (0,0).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,3) WEST (2,2) WEST (1,2) NORTH (1,1) SOUTH (0,1) NORTH (0,0)}$
