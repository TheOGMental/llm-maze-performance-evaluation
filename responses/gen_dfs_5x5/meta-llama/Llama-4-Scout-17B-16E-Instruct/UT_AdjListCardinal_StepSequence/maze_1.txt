OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is given in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (2,1) and the target is at (1,4).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (2,1), the possible movements are: NORTH (1,1), SOUTH (3,1), EAST (2,2), and WEST (2,0).

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
We need to find a path from (2,1) to (1,4). Let's start by moving NORTH from (2,1) to (1,1).

## 4: Continue exploring from (1,1)
From (1,1), the possible movements are: NORTH (0,1), SOUTH (2,1), EAST (1,2), and WEST (1,0). We aim to get closer to (1,4), so moving EAST seems promising.

## 5: Move EAST from (1,1)
Moving EAST from (1,1) to (1,2). From (1,2), we can move: NORTH (0,2), SOUTH (2,2), EAST (1,3), and WEST (1,1).

## 6: Continue moving towards the target
From (1,2), moving EAST to (1,3). From (1,3), the movements are: NORTH (0,3), SOUTH (2,3), EAST (1,4), and WEST (1,2).

## 7: Reach the target
From (1,3), moving EAST directly takes us to (1,4), which is the target.

## 8: Construct the path
The path from (2,1) to (1,4) is: (2,1) NORTH (1,1) EAST (1,2) EAST (1,3) EAST (1,4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,1) NORTH (1,1) EAST (1,2) EAST (1,3) EAST (1,4)}$
