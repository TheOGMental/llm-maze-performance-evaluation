OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (2,4) and the target is at (3,4).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (2,4), we can see the possible movements are not directly listed, but based on the target and origin, we infer movements: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST.

## 3: Analyze the adjacency list for a path to the target
The adjacency list shows:
- (1,1) <--> NORTH (0,2) ...
- (1,1) <--> SOUTH (0,4) ...
- (1,1) <--> SOUTH (1,3) ...
- (1,1) <--> SOUTH (3,3) ...
- (1,1) <--> NORTH (3,4) ...
- (3,4) <--> NORTH (4,3) ...
- (3,4) <--> NORTH (4,4) ...
- (3,4) <--> NORTH (0,2) ...
- (0,2) <--> EAST (0,3) ...
- (1,2) <--> EAST (1,3) is implied but not directly shown, however (1,1) <--> EAST (1,2) and (1,2) <--> SOUTH (1,3) can be used.
- (1,4) <--> WEST (1,3) ...

## 4: Determine the direct connections to the origin and target
The origin (2,4) is directly connected to (3,4) as implied by the target, and potentially to other cells not directly listed but inferred through the maze structure.

## 5: Find a path from the origin (2,4) to the target (3,4)
Given that (3,3) <--> SOUTH (3,4) and there's a connection from (2,4) to (3,3) or directly to (3,4) if it exists, we look for a path:
- Directly moving from (2,4) to (3,4) if possible.

## 6: Analyze connections for a viable path
Since (2,4) is not directly connected to any cell in the list, we infer:
- There's no direct NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST listed for (2,4), but we see (3,3) <--> SOUTH (3,4) and need to find a path to (3,3) from (2,4).

## 7: Explore possible paths
Given (1,1) <--> SOUTH (3,3), and assuming (2,4) could connect to cells around it, let's assume a connection to (2,3) or directly to (3,3) or (3,4) if it exists.

## 8: Identify a specific path
Noticing (3,4) is the target and assuming a potential path:
- If (2,4) connects to (3,4) directly or through another cell.

## 9: Construct a path based on given connections
Since direct connections for (2,4) are not provided, let's assume and verify:
- A potential path could be (2,4) -> (3,4) if it exists directly.

## 10: Verify the path
Given that there's no explicit connection listed for (2,4) to any other node, but seeing (3,3) <--> SOUTH (3,4), let's find a path to (3,3).

## 11: Detailed path finding
Assuming (2,4) to (2,3) is possible (though not listed), and then:
- (2,3) to (3,3) is a potential move (EAST).

## 12: Finalize the path
The path could be: (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2,4) EAST (3,4)}$
