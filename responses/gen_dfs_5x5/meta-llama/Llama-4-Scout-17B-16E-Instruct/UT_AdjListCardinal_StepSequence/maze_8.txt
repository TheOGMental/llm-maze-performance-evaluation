OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (4,0) and the target is at (2,0).

## 2: Identify the relevant connections for the origin and target
From the origin (4,0), the possible moves are NORTH (3,0), SOUTH is not an option as it's not listed, and EAST (4,1). The target (2,0) has a connection to NORTH (1,4) is not directly relevant but (2,0) is connected to (4,0) through NORTH.

## 3: Determine the path from origin to target
Given that (4,0) is connected to (2,0) directly through a NORTH move, we can establish a straightforward path.

## 4: Construct the path
The path from (4,0) to (2,0) is simply moving NORTH from (4,0) to (2,0) since they are directly connected.

## 5: Verify the path with the given format
The path in the required format is: (4,0) NORTH (2,0).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4,0) NORTH (2,0)}$
