OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (3,3) and the target is at (3,0).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (3,3), the possible movements are EAST (4,3), WEST (2,3), NORTH (2,3) is not directly connected, SOUTH (3,2), and other directions based on the given adjacency list.

## 3: Correctly interpret the adjacency list for the given maze
The correct interpretation of the adjacency list is as follows:
- (4,0) is connected to NORTH (3,1), SOUTH (3,0), EAST (3,2) is not directly connected to (4,0), but (4,0) is connected to SOUTH (3,0) and NORTH (3,1).
- (3,0) is connected to NORTH (4,0), SOUTH is not an option as it's at the bottom, EAST (3,1) is not listed but (3,0) is connected to EAST (4,0) indirectly through other points.

## 4: Determine the actual connections for relevant cells
- (3,3) is connected to EAST (4,3), WEST (2,3), and SOUTH (3,2).
- (3,0) is connected to NORTH (4,0).

## 5: Find a path from the origin (3,3) to the target (3,0)
To find a path, start at (3,3) and move towards (3,0).
- From (3,3), move SOUTH to (3,2).
- From (3,2), move SOUTH to (3,1).
- From (3,1), move SOUTH to (3,0).

## 6: Verify the path using the given connections
The path (3,3) -> SOUTH (3,2) -> SOUTH (3,1) -> SOUTH (3,0) seems direct but we need to ensure it aligns with given connections.

## 7: Confirm the path
Given that (3,3) <--> SOUTH (3,2), (3,2) <--> SOUTH (3,1), and (3,1) <--> SOUTH (3,0), the path is confirmed.

## 8: Write down the path
The path from (3,3) to (3,0) is: (3,3) SOUTH (3,2) SOUTH (3,1) SOUTH (3,0).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3,3) SOUTH (3,2) SOUTH (3,1) SOUTH (3,0)}$
