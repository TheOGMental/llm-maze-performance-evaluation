OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (3, 1) and the target is at (1, 4).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (3, 1), the possible movements are NORTH to (3, 2), SOUTH to (4, 1), and EAST to (3, 2) is not directly available but (3,1) is connected to (3,2) and (4,1).

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
Starting from (3, 1), we can move NORTH to (3, 2), then from (3, 2) we can move NORTH to (3, 3), and from (3, 3) we can move NORTH to (3, 4) but there's no direct connection from (3,3) or (3,4) to (1,4) that is simple. Let's correct the approach by systematically exploring connections.

## 4: Systematic exploration
- From (3,1), moving NORTH to (3,2).
- (3,2) is connected to (3,3) and (2,3) and (4,2).
- Let's explore moving to (2,3): From (2,3), we can move to (1,2) and (2,4) and (3,3).
- From (1,2), we can move to (0,3) and (1,4).

## 5: Construct the path
The path can be constructed as follows: (3, 1) -> NORTH -> (3, 2) -> NORTH -> (3, 3) -> SOUTH -> (2, 3) -> SOUTH -> (1, 2) -> SOUTH -> (1, 4).

## 6: Verify the path
Verify that the constructed path is valid and reaches the target from the origin without any contradictions.

The final answer is: 
(3, 1) NORTH (3, 2) NORTH (3, 3) SOUTH (2, 3) SOUTH (1, 2) SOUTH (1, 4)
