OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the maze configuration
The given maze configuration is represented as an adjacency list, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (1, 0) and the target is at (1, 2).

## 2: Identify the connections from the origin
From (1, 0), we can move NORTH to (1, 1) or SOUTH to (2, 0).

## 3: Explore the possible paths to the target
Since the target is at (1, 2), we should try to move in a way that increases the y-coordinate (moving NORTH) from the origin.

## 4: Analyze the direct path from origin to target
Moving directly from (1, 0) to (1, 2) involves moving NORTH twice.

## 5: Verify the path using the adjacency list
The adjacency list shows that (1, 0) is connected to (1, 2) via NORTH, but it also lists connections to other cells. However, to reach (1, 2) directly from (1, 0), we follow the NORTH direction.

## 6: Construct the path
The path from (1, 0) to (1, 2) is: (1, 0) NORTH (1, 1) NORTH (1, 2).

## 7: Confirm the path with the given format
The path in the required format is: (1, 0) NORTH (1, 1) NORTH (1, 2).

The final answer is: 
(1, 0) NORTH (1, 1) NORTH (1, 2)
