OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is given in an adjacency list format, showing which cells are connected to each other. The origin and target cells are also specified.

## 2: Identify the origin and target cells
The origin cell is at coordinates (4, 3) and the target cell is at coordinates (3, 2).

## 3: Analyze the connections to find a path
From the given adjacency list:
- (3, 0) is connected to (3, 2) South.
- (3, 2) is connected to (3, 0) North and (4, 4) is connected to (3, 3) North, but there's no direct connection listed from (3, 2) to any cell that would lead directly to (4, 3).
- (4, 4) is connected to (3, 3) North.
- (3, 3) is connected to (4, 4) South and (3, 4) West.
- (3, 4) is connected to (3, 3) East and (4, 3) West is not listed but (4, 3) is connected to (4, 0) East and (4, 2) West is not listed but (4, 2) is connected to (4, 3) East.

## 4: Determine the path from origin to target
Given the origin (4, 3) and target (3, 2), let's find a path:
- Start at (4, 3).
- (4, 3) is connected to (4, 0) East and (4, 2) West is not directly listed but we see (4, 2) <--> WEST (4, 3) <--> EAST, implying a connection.
- However, a more straightforward path seems to be: (4,3) to (4,2) since (4,2) <--> WEST (4,3) and (4,2) <--> EAST, and (4,2) is connected to (3,2) South is not listed but (3,2) <--> SOUTH (3,0) and other connections.

## 5: Correctly map out the path
Given:
- (4, 3) <--> EAST (4, 2)
- (4, 2) <--> EAST (no direct target) but (4,2) <--> WEST (4,3)
- Direct connection to target: (3,2)

## 6: Finding the actual path
Since (4,3) <--> EAST (4,2) and there's no direct South connection from (4,2) or (4,3) to (3,2), let's re-evaluate:
- (4,3) to (3,3) is not directly listed.
- But (4,4) <--> NORTH (3,3) and (3,3) <--> WEST (3,4) and (3,4) <--> WEST (4,3) which is a cycle.

## 7: Re-evaluate connections for a viable path
- From (4,3), move East to (4,2) because (4,2) <--> WEST (4,3).
- Then, we need to get to (3,2). Noting (4,4) <--> NORTH (3,3) and (3,3) <--> WEST (3,4), and (3,4) <--> WEST (4,3), let's try moving North: There's no direct North from (4,3) or (4,2).

## 8: Apply correct movement
Given that:
- (3,2) is the target.
- A potential path could involve moving in a way that utilizes given connections efficiently.

## 9: Final path determination
The direct and indirect connections suggest:
- Start (4,3)
- Move to (4,2) since it's directly connected.
- Then, we see (3,2) is directly connected to (3,0) North, implying we could go South from a cell above it.

## 10: Explicit path
Given (4,2) and aiming for (3,2):
- (4,2) to (3,2) is a direct connection.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3) EAST (4, 2) NORTH (3, 2)}$
