OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (4, 4) and the target is at (4, 2).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (4, 4), the possible movements are: SOUTH is not an option since it's out of bounds, NORTH is not directly listed but we see (4, 4) <--> NORTH is not directly connected to any cell, however, (4, 4) <--> NORTH is connected to (3, 4) and then from (3, 4) we can move NORTH.

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
Starting from (4, 4), we see it's connected to (3, 4) through NORTH. From (3, 4), we can move NORTH to (2, 4) but there's no direct connection listed for (2, 4) moving towards our target efficiently. However, noticing (4, 4) <--> WEST is not listed but (4, 3) and (4, 2) are connected to cells that could lead us to the target.

## 4: Analyze connections relevant to reaching the target (4, 2)
We notice (4, 2) is connected to (4, 3) through EAST and (4, 3) is connected to (3, 3) through NORTH, and further connections can be explored.

## 5: Determine a path from origin to target
Given the origin (4, 4) and target (4, 2), a direct path seems feasible by moving WEST or SOUTH and then adjusting. However, the direct connections provided must be followed:
- From (4, 4), we can move WEST to (4, 3).

## 6: Continue the path
- From (4, 3), we can move WEST to (4, 2).

## 7: Verify the path
The path from (4, 4) to (4, 3) to (4, 2) seems direct and efficient given the connections.

## 8: Express the path in the required format
The path is: (4, 4) WEST (4, 3) WEST (4, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4) WEST (4, 3) WEST (4, 2)}$
