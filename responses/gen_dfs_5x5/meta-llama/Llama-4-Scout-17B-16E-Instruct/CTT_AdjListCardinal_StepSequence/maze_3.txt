OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (0,1) and the target is at (0,4).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (0,1), the possible movements are SOUTH to (0,3) and SOUTH to (0,4) is not directly available, but we can move SOUTH to (0,3) and then try to find a path to (0,4).

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
Starting from (0,1), move SOUTH to (0,3). From (0,3), we can move SOUTH to (0,4), which is the target.

## 4: Verify if the path is valid and direct
The path from (0,1) to (0,3) to (0,4) seems direct and valid as per the given adjacency list.

## 5: Represent the path in the required format
The path can be represented as: (0,1) SOUTH (0,3) SOUTH (0,4).

The final answer is: 
(0,1) SOUTH (0,3) SOUTH (0,4)
