OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze is represented as an adjacency list, showing the connections between different cells. The origin is at (1, 0) and the target is at (4, 0).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From (1, 0), the possible movements are NORTH to (0, 3) and SOUTH to (2, 0).

## 3: Explore the maze to find a path to the target
Starting from (1, 0), moving NORTH to (0, 3) does not seem to lead directly to the target. Moving SOUTH to (2, 0) seems promising as it is in the general direction of the target.

## 4: Continue exploring from (2, 0)
From (2, 0), moving NORTH back to (1, 0) is not helpful. Moving SOUTH to (3, 0) is not listed, but moving SOUTH to (2, 1), (2, 2), etc., are possible. However, we need to find a path that leads towards (4, 0).

## 5: Analyze connections to the target area
Noticing that (4, 0) has a connection to (3, 1) through NORTH, we should look for a path to (3, 1) or directly to (4, 0) if possible.

## 6: Find a path from (1, 0) to (4, 0)
From (1, 0), going SOUTH to (2, 0), then SOUTH to (3, 0) is not directly available, but we can go SOUTH to (2, 1), then continue. However, a direct path from (2, 0) to higher rows is needed. Noting (2, 0) connects to (4, 0) through NORTH is not available, but (1, 0) to (2, 0) then to (2, 1), and finding a way up.

## 7: Detailed path exploration
Given (1, 0) <--> NORTH (0, 3), (1, 0) <--> SOUTH (2, 0), and (2, 0) <--> NORTH (1, 0), (2, 0) <--> SOUTH (2, 1), (2, 1) <--> SOUTH (2, 2), (2, 2) <--> SOUTH (3, 3) is not directly helpful. But, (4, 0) <--> NORTH (3, 1) and other connections indicate a potential path through (3, 1) or directly.

## 8: Constructing the path
A potential path could be: (1, 0) -> SOUTH (2, 0) -> SOUTH (2, 1) -> SOUTH (2, 2) -> SOUTH (3, 3) -> NORTH (4, 0) or finding a more direct route if available.

## 9: Verify the path
Let's verify if (1, 0) -> SOUTH (2, 0) -> SOUTH (2, 1) -> SOUTH (2, 2) -> SOUTH (3, 3) -> NORTH (4, 0) is valid and correct.

## 10: Confirm the solution
The path (1, 0) -> SOUTH (2, 0) -> SOUTH (2, 1) -> SOUTH (2, 2) -> SOUTH (3, 3) -> NORTH (4, 0) seems valid based on given connections.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 0) SOUTH (2, 0) SOUTH (2, 1) SOUTH (2, 2) SOUTH (3, 3) NORTH (4, 0)}$
