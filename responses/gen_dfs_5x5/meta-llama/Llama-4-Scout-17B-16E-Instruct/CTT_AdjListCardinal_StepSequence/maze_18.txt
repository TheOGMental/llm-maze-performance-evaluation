OUTPUT:
## Step 1: Understand the given maze configuration
The maze configuration is provided in an adjacency list format, showing the connections between different cells in the maze. The origin is at (1,0) and the target is at (1,1).

## 2: Identify the possible movements from the origin
From the origin (1,0), we can see the possible movements are: NORTH (0,0) is not directly connected, but (1,0) is connected to (0,0) and (1,1) is not directly listed but (1,0) <--> SOUTH (1,1) is not listed, however (0,0) <--> SOUTH (1,0) and (1,1) <--> NORTH (1,0) is not directly provided but we see (0,0) <--> SOUTH (1,0) and (1,0) <--> SOUTH is connected to (1,4) and (2,0) and (3,1) is not directly connected to (1,0).

## 3: Determine the direct connections of the origin
Direct connections from (1,0) are to (0,0), (1,4), (2,0), and there's a connection to (1,1) as (1,1) <--> NORTH (1,0).

## 4: Find a path from the origin to the target
Given that (1,0) is directly connected to (1,1) through a NORTH movement from (1,1) to (1,0), we can infer the path is simply moving NORTH is not correct as per given data, instead we see (1,1) is connected to (1,0) so we move from (1,0) to (1,1) which is a direct connection.

## 5: Construct the path
The path from (1,0) to (1,1) is straightforward since (1,0) <--> NORTH is not listed but (1,1) <--> NORTH (1,0) indicates a direct link, implying we can go from (1,0) to (1,1) by moving EAST or other directions are not required as (1,1) is directly accessible.

## 6: Specify the movement
Given (1,0) and (1,1) are directly connected through NORTH from (1,1) to (1,0), the movement from (1,0) to (1,1) would be considered as moving EAST or directly as per maze connection which seems to be directly connected.

## 7: Provide the path based on given connections
Since there's a direct connection indicated between (1,0) and (1,1), and assuming standard movement (up, down, left, right), and given that (1,1) <--> NORTH (1,0), the path would simply be: (1,0) NORTH (1,1) or simply stated as moving in the direction that connects them which seems to be a direct link.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1,0)  (1,1)}$
