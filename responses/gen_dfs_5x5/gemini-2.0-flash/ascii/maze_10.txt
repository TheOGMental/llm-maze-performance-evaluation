OUTPUT:
Here's a solution path for the maze, represented by a sequence of moves (N=North, S=South, E=East, W=West):

**Path:**

S E E E E E N N W W W S S S E E E E N N W W S S E E N N W W S S E E E E N N W W S S E E N N W W

**Explanation:**

*   Start at S
*   Go South (S), then East until the end
*   Go North twice (N N), then West until you can't
*   Go South thrice (S S S) then East until you can't
*   Go North twice (N N), then West until you can't
*   Go South twice (S S), then East twice
*   Go North twice (N N), then West twice
*   Go South twice (S S), then East twice
*   Go North twice (N N), then West twice
*   Go South twice (S S), then East four times
*   Go North twice (N N), then West twice
*   Go South twice (S S), then East twice
*   Go North twice (N N), then West twice until you reach the E

This path guides you from the 'S' to the 'E' in the maze, avoiding walls.
